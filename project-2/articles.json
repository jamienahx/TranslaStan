And a strong zoom lens is crucial for fans seated far from the stage.So, phones with 10x optical zoom lenses are now a key part of the concert survival tool kit.At least a dozen established businesses in Southeast Asia offer day rentals of phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Galaxy S24 Ultra for under $50.Both phones, released in February 2023 and January 2024, respectively, have strong 10x optical zoom lenses. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.$30 to rent a Samsung phone for a daySmall businesses and individuals rent phones for concert day use all across Southeast Asia. But in South Korea — the home of K-pop, where concerts go on all year round — the market is particularly hot.One business offering this phone rental service is Snapshoot. Founded in 2022, the company rents phones for 30,000 to 50,000 South Korean won, or about $22 to $37, daily.Mingwan Jeong, the founder of Snapshoot, told BI his business serves hundreds of customers monthly and is increasingly attracting customers from outside South Korea, such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\"When Samsung released the S22 Ultra, their promotional slogan emphasized its capability to 'photograph the moon,'\" Jeong said. \"Fans quickly recognized that this advanced camera could help them capture their idols clearly at concerts.\"He said Snapshoot started in 2022 with a small inventory of 10 phones, but now keeps several hundred smartphones in stock at any given time.Another example is Woori Mobile Service, a South Korean telecommunications company that started renting out phones in 2023. Its collection points are at Seoul's Konkuk University and the hip Sinchon neighborhood. It also has a pickup point at Seoul's Incheon airport, catering to Woori's foreign clients.\"Many of them didn't own the latest smartphones or didn't want the hassle of international roaming,\" Han Da Bean, a spokesperson for Woori Mobile, told BI.The company offers rentals of the S23 and S24 models, charging 35,000 won or about $25 per day, and a 10,000 won daily reservation fee.\n              \n              \n              \n              \n                \n            \n              \n              \n              \n            \n              \n              \n                    \n                      Woori Mobile Service, a South Korean telecommunications company, offers day rentals of Samsung phones, which come in handy pouches.\n                      \n              \n              \n              Woori Mobile\n              \n              \n                    \n                  \n              \n            \"Samsung's flagship models like the S23 Ultra and S24 Ultra offer exceptional camera and audio capabilities, especially in low light and concert environments, making them ideal for fans looking to record memories in high definition,\" Han added.He said the company serves 50 to 100 rental customers a month, typically renting out the phones for three to seven days. They see a spike in activity during major K-pop festivals and tour seasons, he added.Han said Woori Mobile keeps an inventory of about 20 Samsung devices, but it plans to expand to other models like the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series and add more mid-range models for budget-conscious users.Forholiday, a luggage storage and rental company in Seoul, also offers phone rentals, with its services available on Klook. It has rented phones to more than 2,000 customers, per the Klook listing.The company rents the S23 Ultra for 11,800 won and the S24 Ultra for 15,700 won daily.Forholiday's CEO, Shin Dong-min, told BI the company's phone rentals are a stopgap for cost-conscious fans.\"It is inevitably burdensome to buy expensive mobile phones to use them for a short period,\" Shin said.Shin said Forholiday sees the most demand around concerts by boy bands BTS, Seventeen, Stray Kids, and Zerobaseone.Worth every centSome K-pop fans who've rented phones for concerts have said the experience was worth every cent.\"I own an iPhone 11, which works pretty well except the phone camera is limited to a 3x, which means I can't do any close-up fancams if I'm in any seat beyond VIP,\" Ghia Hong, a content creator from Malaysia, told BI.TikTok user wanderwithgaby also posted about renting a Samsung S25 for 50,000 South Korean won.\"It was the best money I spent,\" she wrote in the caption of a zoomed-in fan video of BTS member J-Hope.\n              \n              \n              \n            A+ marketing for SamsungTo be sure, Samsung's smartphones are not the only phones with a strong zoom lens.Google's Pixel 9 Pro's specs say it produces pictures with the quality of a 10x optical zoom. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro has a 5x optical zoom function and a 25x digital zoom option. Other Asian brands like Oppo, Huawei, and Xiaomi are strong contenders, too.Still, the rental service is doing wonders for Samsung's image.Parker Burton, a tech reviewer and content creator on YouTube with over a million followers, said Samsung likely became the phone of choice because the brand has a huge fan base on home ground in South Korea.\"I think a big part of it can stem from the fact that it's a brand that people are used to and familiar with and has a lot of trust and loyalty in the community,\" Burton said.Catherine Bautista, a partner at Flying Fish Lab, a branding consultancy agency in Singapore, said Samsung is also core to fan culture, and rentals have made it \"the default choice for K-pop enthusiasts.\"\"Renting out Galaxy S23/S24 Ultra phones for K-pop concerts is a brilliant reputation booster for Samsung because, instead of simply competing on specs, Samsung dominates a niche need and turns fans into brand ambassadors,\" she said.Bautista said Samsung has also positioned itself as the \"official phone of K-pop\" by sponsoring concerts, featuring top idols in its advertisements, and releasing special edition phones.Samsung recently tapped Felix Lee, a singer from the band Stray Kids, as its newest ambassador. Lee, who is also a house ambassador of fashion powerhouse Louis Vuitton, is the face of the ad campaign for the brand's latest super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge phone.And with Stray Kids now on a 34-city tour, the group's fans can sing, dance, and zoom in on their idols' faces to their hearts' content.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      \n      \n        \n    \n    \n    \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                  Samsung\n                \n          \n            \n          \n    \n            \n              \n              \n              \n                  \n                    \n                      Read next\n                    \n                  \n            \n                \n              \n        \n    \n        \n    \n          \n              \n                \n              \n          \n          \n            \n            \n      \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  "

    "description": "The neighbouring countries have long been embroiled in a war of information. But has there been a recent shift in who has the ‘upper hand’?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98pnx35xj2o",
    "full_text": "7 days agoJean MackenzieSeoul correspondentBBCListen to Jean read this articleThe border between North and South Korea is swamped with layers of dense barbed-wire fencing and hundreds of guard posts. But dotted among them is something even more unusual: giant, green camouflaged speakers.As I stood looking into the North one afternoon last month, one of the speakers began blasting South Korean pop songs interspersed with subversive messages. \"When we travel abroad, it energises us\", a woman's voice boomed out across the border - an obvious slight given North Koreans are not allowed to leave the country.From the North Korean side, I could faintly hear military propaganda music, as its regime attempted to drown out the inflammatory broadcasts.North and South Korea are technically still at war, and although it has been years since either side shelled the other, the two sides are fighting on a more subtle front: a war of information.Getty ImagesThe border is covered with layers of dense barbed-wire fencing and guards patrol the areaThe South tries to get information into the North, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un tries furiously to block it, as he attempts to shield his people from outside information.North Korea is the only country in the world the internet has not penetrated. All TV channels, radio stations and newspapers are run by the state.\"The reason for this control is that so much of the mythology around the Kim family is made up. A lot of what they tell people is lies,\" says Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, and an expert in North Korean technology and information.Expose those lies to enough people and the regime could come crumbling down, is how the thinking in South Korea goes.The loudspeakers are one tool used by the South Korean government, but behind the scenes a more sophisticated underground movement has flourished.A small number of broadcasters and non-profit organisations transmit information into the country in the dead of night on short and medium radio waves, so North Koreans can tune in to listen in secret. Getty ImagesUSB sticks loaded with foreign TV dramas and K-pop music are smuggled into North Korea (pictured K-pop boyband BTS) Thousands of USB sticks and micro-SD cards are also smuggled over the border every month loaded with foreign information - among them, South Korean films, TV dramas, and pop songs, as well as news, all designed to challenge North Korean propaganda.But now those working in the field fear that North Korea is gaining the upper hand.Not only is Kim cracking down hard on those caught with foreign content, but the future of this work could be in jeopardy. Much of it is funded by the US government, and has been hit by US President Donald Trump's recent aid cuts. So where does this leave both sides in their longstanding information war?Smuggling pop songs and TV dramasEvery month, a team at Unification Media Group (UMG), a South Korean non-profit organisation, sift through the latest news and entertainment offerings to put together playlists that they hope will resonate with those in the North.They then load them onto devices, which are categorised according to how risky they are to view. On low-risk USBs are South Korean TV dramas and pop songs - recently they included a Netflix romance series When Life Give You Tangerines, and a hit from popular South Korean singer and rapper Jennie.High-risk options include what the team calls \"education programmes\" – information to teach North Koreans about democracy and human rights, the content Kim is thought to fear the most.The drives are then sent to the Chinese border, where UMG's trusted partners carry them across the river into North Korea at huge risk.AFP via Getty ImagesInformation on low-risk USBs recently included a hit from popular South Korean singer and rapper JennieSouth Korean TV dramas may seem innocuous, but they reveal much about ordinary life there - people living in high-rise apartments, driving fast cars and eating at upmarket restaurants. It highlights both their freedom and how North Korea is many years behind. This challenges one of Kim's biggest fabrications: that those in the South are poor and miserably oppressed.\"Some [people] tell us they cried while watching these dramas, and that they made them think about their own dreams for the very first time\", says Lee Kwang-baek, director of UMG.It is difficult to know exactly how many people access the USBs, but testimonies from recent defectors seem to suggest the information is spreading and having an impact.\"Most recent North Korean defectors and refugees say it was foreign content that motivated them to risk their lives to escape\", says Sokeel Park, whose organisation Liberty in North Korea works to distribute this content.There is no political opposition or known dissidents in North Korea, and gathering to protest is too dangerous – but Mr Park hopes some will be inspired to carry out individual acts of resistance.An escape from North KoreaKang Gyuri, who is 24, grew up in North Korea, where she ran a fishing business. Then in late 2023, she fled to South Korea by boat.Watching foreign TV shows partly inspired her to go, she says. \"I felt so suffocated, and I suddenly had an urge to leave.\"When we met in a park on a sunny afternoon in Seoul last month, she reminisced about listening to radio broadcasts with her mum as a child. She got hold of her first K-drama when she was 10. Years later she learnt that USB sticks and SD cards were being smuggled into the country inside boxes of fruit.The more she watched, the more she realised the government was lying to her. \"I used to think it was normal that the state restricted us so much. I thought other countries lived with this control,\" she explains. \"But then I realised it was only in North Korea.\"Kang Gyuri fled to South Korea by boat in late 2023Almost everyone she knew there watched South Korean TV shows and films. She and her friends would swap their USBs.\"We talked about the popular dramas and actors, and the K-pop idols we thought were good looking, like certain members of BTS. \"We'd also talk about how South Korea's economy was so developed; we just couldn't criticise the North Korean regime outright.\"The shows also influenced how she and her friends talked and dressed, she adds. \"North Korea's youth has changed rapidly.\"Youth crackdown squads and punishmentsKim Jong Un, all too aware of this risk to his regime, is fighting back.During the pandemic, he built new electric fences along the border with China, making it more difficult for information to be smuggled in. And new laws introduced from 2020 have increased the punishments for people who are caught consuming and sharing foreign media. One stated that those who distribute the content could be imprisoned or executed.This has had a chilling effect. \"This media used to be available to buy in markets, people would openly sell it, but now you can only get it from people you trust,\" says Mr Lee.After the crackdown began Ms Kang and her friends became more cautious too. \"We don't talk to each other about this anymore, unless we're really close, and even then we're much more secretive,\" she admits.She says she is aware of more young people being executed for being caught with South Korean content.AFP via Getty ImagesThe effects of some of President Trump of policies may have inadvertently given North Korea a helping hand in the information war, according to some Recently Kim has also cracked down on behaviour that could be associated with watching K-dramas. In 2023 he made it a crime for people to use South Korean phrases or speak in a South Korean accent.Members of 'youth crackdown squads', patrol the streets, tasked with monitoring young people's behaviour. Ms Kang recalls being stopped more often, before she escaped, and reprimanded for dressing and styling her hair like a South Korean. The squads would confiscate her phone and read her text messages, she adds, to make sure she had not used any South Korean terms.Inside a phone smuggled out of North KoreaIn late 2024, a North Korean mobile phone was smuggled out of the country by Daily NK, (Seoul-based media organisation UMG's news service). The phone had been programmed so that when a South Korean variant of a word is entered, it automatically vanishes, replaced with the North Korean equivalent - an Orwellian move.\"Smartphones are now part and parcel of the way North Korea tries to indoctrinate people\", says Mr Williams.Following all these crackdown measures, he believes North Korea is now \"starting to gain the upper hand\" in this information war.Funding cuts and the Trump effectFollowing Donald Trump's return to the White House earlier this year, funds were severed to a number of of aid organisations, including some working to inform North Koreans. He also suspended funds to two federally financed news services, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America (VOA), which had been broadcasting nightly into North Korea.Trump accused VOA of being \"radical\" and anti-Trump\", while the White House said the move would \"ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\". But Steve Herman, a former VOA bureau chief based in Seoul, argues: \"This was one of the very few windows into the world the North Korean people had, and it has gone silent with no explanation.\"More from InDepthUMG is still waiting to find out whether their funding will be permanently cut.Mr Park from Liberty in North Korea argues Trump has \"incidentally\" given Kim a helping hand, and calls the move \"short-sighted\".He argues that North Korea, with its expanding collection of nuclear weapons, poses a major security threat - and that given sanctions, diplomacy and military pressure have failed to convince Kim to denuclearise, information is the best remaining weapon.\"We're not just trying to contain the threat of North Korea, we're trying to solve it,\" he argues. \"To do that you need to change the nature of the country. \"If I was an American general I'd be saying 'how much does this stuff cost, and actually that's a pretty good use of our resources'\".Who should foot the bill?The question that remains is, who should fund this work. Some question why it has fallen almost entirely to the US.One solution could be for South Korea to foot the bill - but the issue of North Korea is heavily politicised here.The liberal opposition party tends to try to improve relations with Pyongyang, meaning funding information warfare is a no go. The party's frontrunner in next week's presidential election has already indicated he would turn off the loudspeakers if elected.Yet Mr Park remains hopeful. \"The good thing is that the North Korean government can't go into people's heads and take out the information that's been building for years,\" he points out.And as technologies develop, he is confident that spreading information will get easier. \"In the long run I really believe this is going to be the thing that changes North Korea\".Top image credit: GettyBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Annoncée il y a maintenant quelques années de cela, la nouvelle production du studio à l’origine de Spider-Man : Across the Spider-Verse et Les Mitchell contre les Machines tient enfin sa date de sortie. KPop Demon Hunters fera son entrée sur la plateforme le 20 juin, et il serait dommage de s’en priver simplement car le titre évoque de la musique pop coréenne. Même si vous n’avez jamais écouté Blackpink, Twice ou Le Sserafim, ou que le principe même d’un boys band comme BTS vous hérisse le poil, on vous promet que ce long-métrage d’animation mérite tout de même votre attention. Si vous ne nous croyez pas, on vous met au défi de ne pas tomber sous le charme de sa bande-annonce :\n\n \n     Superstars le jour, chasseuses de démon la nuit Quelques secondes suffisent à retrouver la direction artistique si captivante à laquelle Sony Pictures Animation nous a habitués ces dernières années. Lumières, mouvements, expressions faciales, décors… tous les éléments visuels sont exacerbés pour un résultat plus vibrant que jamais. Et quoi de mieux qu’un groupe atypique de pop-stars pour mettre le style du studio en valeur ? KPop Demon Hunters nous présente l’histoire de Rumi, Mira et Zoey, trois idoles sud-coréennes à la double vie pour le moins chargée. Lorsque le trio ne remplit pas des stades entiers à travers le globe, les trois jeunes femmes doivent enfiler leur identité secrète de chasseuses de démons pour protéger l’humanité. Mais cette fois-ci, leurs ennemis de la nuit viennent les attaquer sur leur propre terrain. Lorsqu’un nouveau boys band commence à détruire leur réputation et à voler leurs fans, les héroïnes comprennent que ces chanteurs top modèles tout droit tirés d’un magazine pour ado n’ont rien d’humain. Les démons ont compris que la  souhaitent profiter de la popularité de la KPop pour dévorer les âmes des foules de spectateurs.\n\n Une bande-son par des stars de la K-pop Qu’est-ce que serait un film d’animation inspiré par la K-pop sans un morceau original composé pour  l’accompagner ? Les fans du groupe Twice seront ravis d’apprendre que Jeongyeon, Jihyo et Chaeyoung y interprètent “Takedown“, une chanson inédite dont un extrait a d’ores et déjà été partagé dans la bande-annonce. Une chose est sûre : ce premier aperçu du film promet une bande-son à la hauteur des visuels flamboyants.  🟣 Pour ne manquer aucune news sur le Journal du Geek, abonnez-vous sur Google Actualités et sur notre WhatsApp. Et si vous nous adorez, on a une newsletter tous les matins.

    "description": "Come with us for 72 hours in Seoul as PUMA celebrates the newest addition to its low-profile, y2k sneaker family: the H Street.",
    "url": "https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/puma-h-street-launch-seoul/",
    "full_text": "“I went a little bold with my outfit today, what do you think?” A smiling Yeji, wrapped in a blackish-green cyber bodysuit, has just stepped into a cavernous warehouse space in Seoul’s Seongsu district. And no, she’s not about to perform—indeed, her fellow members of K-pop girl group ITZY are nowhere to be seen—she’s just here to say hi. Hi, specifically, to PUMA, who are holding a special celebration.Today, this Berghain-adjacent chamber in the heart of 'Seoul’s Brooklyn' is the site of a global party for the pair of wafer-thin, y2k-themed, and very luminous green sneakers that adorn Yeji’s feet: the new PUMA H-Street.Yeji is one of the many stars who turned out for PUMA’s three-day activation held in honor of its new shoe, a sort of track and field-inspired successor to the motorsport-based (and wildly popular) Speedcat. Other stars who arrived rocking the new silhouette included BLACKPINK’s Rosé, Squid Game’s Yuri Jo, and THE BOYZ’s Juyeon. These are names recognisable even to those who couldn’t name a single K-pop hit.Perhaps this insane line-up shouldn’t have been surprising: with Rosé as an ambassador and ongoing collaborations with Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, as well as a special talent for tapping into underground scenes worldwide, it’s safe to say PUMA have captured their niche of sports style lovers in a way that few other brands have managed. And it’s showing no intention of slowing down.Juyeon, a member of the aptly-named 11-piece K-pop boy band THE BOYZ, would agree. “This event has such a fresh and stylish atmosphere,” he notes. “It goes beyond just sneakers—it really feels like an immersive cultural experience.”Cultural experience it certainly was—even PUMA’s extensive list of collaborators showed its understanding of the Korean scene it was a guest in. Tea and pastries were provided by the famous Café Onion, an it-spot on Seoul’s ever-buzzy coffee scene; COLD Archive curated an immersive pop-up experience; and Eyesmag provided a bespoke styling and photo studio. This is to name but a few of the creators involved: local artists and DJs comprised the backbone of the weekend’s programming.At the centre of the activation was a rare collection of PUMA sneakers, curated by Inside Tag. Running from the ‘70s to 2007, these archival silhouettes—collected over years of combing through second-hand sites—gave an insight into the breadth of reference and inspiration behind the new shoe, including, crucially, the original H-Street from 2003.Dropping on June 28, the release of this  sneaker is set to be a real moment for PUMA, and for the sneaker landscape in general. Speaking on the brand's trajectory, the head of PUMA Select Gregor Abenstein is enthusiastic: “We have such an iconic archive, especially around that time in the early 2000s. [...] We started the low profile trend with the Mostro and Speedcat, and this is the next chapter.”But a brand is only as good as its products make people feel. And who better to give PUMA the seal of approval than K-pop idol Yeji, as the brand touches down in Seoul? \"Personally, I feel like PUMA is a brand that gives me confidence,” Yeji tells us. “It stays true to its heritage but also takes bold steps when it comes to style — and I really love that.\""

    "full_text": "When Houston Rockets forward Dillon Brooks stepped into the arena ahead of the team’s first-round series game against the Golden State Warriors dressed in a pair of tapered pinstripe pants and a navy jacket, NBA mainstays and commentators Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal burst out laughing. They’d honed in on the accessory swinging from Brooks’ belt loop: a fuzzy, peach lop-eared monster known as Labubu.“That’s how you come to work, with a damn bunny on your hip,” Barkley howled.Labubu is the latest in a lineage of soft, coquettish, rabidly sought-after collectible trinkets in the vein of Sanrio and Sonny Angels. Designed by a Hong Kong-based artist in 2015, the creatures’ likeness was purchased by global collectables brand Pop Mart in 2019. Four years later, Pop Mart put out the first wave of Labubu keychains and converted  legions of 20-somethings into superfans, including celebrities such as Rihanna, Blackpink’s Lisa, and men’s streetwear icons like Central Cee. Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.With their close-set cartoon eyes and furrowed brows, the always-sold-out toys have become status symbols of delicate girlhood, dangling from purses, backpacks, and keychains. Fueled in part by the success of Labubu, Pop Mart was recently valued at $1.6 billion.Observers were quick to point out that Barkley and O’Neal might be laughing, but in fact they were out of their depth. “Everyone is looking that guy up,” 27-year-old Labubu fan Nadeen Ezzeddine said on TikTok, referring to Brooks. “We love him now. You guys can laugh all you want; you’re not in the club. Get with it. Your age is showing.” Adrianna L., 30, who captioned a recent TikTok post “wearing my Labubu but in a Dillon Brooks kind of way,” agreed.“I had no context of who this was,” she said. “I went from knowing nothing about him to rooting for him when I see the Rockets play.”Separate from his Labubu fandom, Brooks is one of the most controversial figures in the wider theater of the NBA. Dillon the villain, as he’s been nicknamed, has been accused of being the “dirtiest player in the NBA,” having received a one-game suspension after 16 technical fouls this season. The Canadian-born player has made a name for himself as cocky, aggressive, and quick to disparage, sometimes letting his mouth run ahead of his game. He’s trash-talked everyone from LeBron James to Draymond Green and shoved a camera operator during a ball scuffle.Pop Mart, Pop Mart, Pop MartEzzeddine doesn’t know or care about any of that, though. She first encountered Brooks because of his Labubu, on her TikTok For You Page. “I don’t really watch sports, and there was some heated debate about him in the comments saying he was a ‘dirty player,’” she said. “And I was like, I’m sorry, I don’t care that much. My mans is wearing a Labubu, and that’s a hard yes from me.”For her, the co-sign from an athlete in a historically hypermasculine sport is part of the charm of the moment. “I thought it was cute,” Ezzeddine said. “Someone more mainstream — especially an athlete who’s seen as this tough, polar-opposite person — showing one off is hilarious.” “Dillon Brooks wearing a Labubu is so girlypop,” said Amy, another Labubu fan who’s been following the NBA for the past two yearsA representative for Pop Mart told Highsnobiety that Brooks’ pre-game look gave Labubu a fresh entry point into the sports world: “Labubu’s attitude and just the right amount of mischief were a perfect match for Brooks, and moments like these show how our characters are connecting beyond traditional collectors and reaching new fans in unexpected places.”For Labubu fans, the commentators’ confusion is part of the joke — the bat signal of a girlypop calling out to other girlypops, flying under the radar of men who just don’t get the whimsy of Labubu (who, it should be noted, is a monster, not a bunny). “I lowkey hope he keeps wearing Labubu,” Adrianna said. “I thought it was hysterical that every commentator was confused.”In fact, Brooks’ choice of accessory speaks to a larger wormhole opening between two corners of the internet: the whimsical, blush-colored world of Labubu and Sonny Angels, and the basketball fandom and its idolization of macho, savage prowess. After Le Sserafim’s American member Yunjin named LeBron James as her favorite Lakers player, the basketball legend embraced the K-pop fandom, posting on Instagram that Le Sserafim’s song “Crazy” “goes crazy.” One fancam edit linking the two tracked 1.6 million views, while others superimposed Hello Kitty ears onto James, or compiled clips of him dancing whimsically.Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.The fancam genre is a popular one. TikTok editor @orangecactus556 has carved out a niche posting supercuts of NBA players set to various K-pop songs — high-energy compilations of Kyrie Iriving and Anthony Edwards set against the saccharine soprano of Twice and Red Velvet — with some of their videos racking up millions of views. First introduced to K-pop by some of their own basketball teammates, they told Highsnobiety that part of the fun in their content is its unexpected nature. “K-pop and the NBA are pretty common interests, but I feel like most people wouldn’t think to pair them,” they said. “I think the fact that there’s actually a pretty big overlap between the fans is cool and fun.”@orangecactus556 noted that there are similarities between the two fan cultures. “Sports fans are pretty crazy about their favorite players and teams, and from what I’ve seen, K-pop fans can be crazy about their favorite groups, too. I think some of the nomenclature shares similarities — for example, rookie and maknae,” or youngest member of a group, “are kind of equivalent.”Part of the synergy is the fact that, in both cases, it’s all theater. The fun of Labubu is the lengths fans go to to get ahold of them, the feeling of belonging to a culture that only they understand, and the thrill of recognizing a fellow traveler in the wild. The same has always been true for sports stans. It’s not always that serious, though; the joke is part of the fun. Ezzeddine doesn’t think she’s going to become an avid Brooks fan anytime soon.“Tell him to wear Skull Panda next,” she joked, “and then we’ll see.”"

    "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2025/05/08/lee-soo-man-the-king-of-k-pop-explores-origins-of-k-pop-culture/",
    "full_text": "Lee Soo Man created many of k-pop's most iconic bands.Prime\nTing Poo was not a k-pop fan when she first considered making a documentary about k-pop visionary Lee Soo-man. But then her documentary, Lee Soo Man, The King of K-Pop is not just about the inventive pop music that quickly gained a worldwide following. It’s also the story of Korea’s economic miracle, the soft power of pop culture and the continued reinvention of culture by emerging technology, seen through the lens of one of k-pop’s primary architects.\n\n\n“I actually saw it as an opportunity to delve into this world,” said Poo. “It has had such an impact globally on pop culture and I think there's just a fascination with it, myself included, but I didn't have deep knowledge of it and I wasn't a diehard fan.”\n\nThe director is known for her documentaries of actor Val Kilmer and Christina Aguilera, as well as editing the Academy Award-winning short Heaven Is A Traffic Jam On The 405. If you want to explore k-pop, she reasoned, there is perhaps no one better to focus on than Lee, the business executive and record producer who founded the multinational entertainment company SM Entertainment in 1989. Considered one of the pioneers of the Hallyu or Korean Wave, he debuted as a singer in 1971 while studying at Seoul National University. In the 80s he decided to study computer engineering in California and witnessed the rise of MTV. When he returned to Korea, his unique background in music and engineering led to the creation of many of the nation’s most beloved k-pop acts, thereby shaping the entire industry.\n\n\n“He was so instrumental in the creation of it and creating the architecture by which it’s made that it was an opportunity to really delve back and see the genesis of the genre,” said Poo.\n\nThe intense training system that k-pop groups undergo—that was Lee’s idea. After promoting a singer, whose poorly thought out private life almost ruined his company, Lee created a system where he would sequester talent, train them, and make sure they presented a clean public image.In the documentary Lee looks back on his successes and the failures it took to get to success.Prime\n\n\n“He learned a hard lesson from that,” said Poo. “For a lot of people that would’ve been a time to quit and be like, this is not going to work. He realized that the character of these people is just as important as the music that they’re creating, that those kinds of controversies can be avoided, and he really built the system around that.”\nCreating groups with many members was also an idea Lee championed. The universe that some k-pop groups live in—complete with a back story and even avatars—was another idea that Lee promoted. He created some of k-pop’s most memorable groups—H.O.T., Girls Generation, TVXQ, EXO, Super Junior, NCT 127 and Aespa—during a time in South Korean history that saw political upheaval but also unprecedented national growth. Lee saw k-pop as a cultural export that could further interest the world in Korean culture and products—and it has.\n\nThe director had many storylines to incorporate in her documentary.\n“There’s this personal story, his career story, and then there’s this larger story of Korea, and those three things are really interwoven,” said Poo. “So it’s more or less chronological, but the challenge was in finding the way to weave all those things together because they were all very much dependent on each other. His journey goes side by side and is completely interwoven with the journey of Korea from after the Korean War up to the cultural powerhouse that it is now. There were very specific things that happened within that country that coincided with him trying to create this industry.”\n\n\nPoo loves music and sees it as a powerful and far-reaching medium that crosses cultural boundaries.\n“A lot of art does and film does,\" said Poo. \"But music does in its own special way. I’m always fascinated by artists themselves, what translates from their life into the music, what is being expressed that is kind of universal, is able to cross those boundaries. And for Lee Soo man, a lot of his inspiration came from watching MTV and cultivating the world of k-pop around this visual medium. It’s not just the music, it’s the artistry, the choreography, the filmmaking around it. His music in particular is like a multidisciplinary art form.”\nFor those new to k-pop, just listening to k-pop is not enough. It’s a very visual medium.\n“You have to see it,” said Poo. “And then there’s also worlds that are created around these bands. When idols are made, they have personalities and there’s individuals that you can connect to. There's also mythology that he built around them, which you see, which is its world creation. So it's really fascinating.”\nThe documentary includes videos by several of Lee’s SM artists. There were a lot of videos to consider.\n“They’ve created so many groups and amazing groups with huge fan bases, so it was difficult to choose,” said Poo. “We decided to lean into the groups that represented a strategic shift in what he was trying to do, pillars that marked a new strategy, a new pathway. So H.O.T. was obviously the first boy group that was designed not just to be huge in Korea, but to go to China. BOA was learning Japanese to expand her reach into Japan. Super Junior was his first foray into the super group to have many people with many talents, and then obviously the world building and the mythology with EXO.”\nPromoting an artist that almost tanked his company was not the only setback that Lee faced. Members of one of SM’s biggest groups TVXQ sued to get out of their contracts and went their own way. The deaths of two SM stars broke many hearts. SM singer-songwriter and SHINee member Jonghyun committed suicide in 2017 at the age of 27. SM singer and actress Sulli  took her life at the age of 25. The documentary touches on the conflict with TVXQ members, as well as the deaths of these beloved performers. It also relates the story of how Lee was ultimately forced out of SM by his nephew, which led Lee to form an investment company, Blooming Grace, and a new entertainment agency, A20 Entertainment. The director wanted to include all sides of Lee’s story.\n“He understood why it was important to include and I just gave him the space to talk about it,\" said Poo. \"There were no questions that were off limits. All of those things are a part of his story, and I made it clear that his life wasn't just success after success after success. There were a lot of tragedies, there were a lot of difficult things that happened. The death of Jonghyun was something that greatly impacted him as an individual, SM as a family and the entire community. It was a huge tragedy that everybody went through and to not include that would just seem wrong.”\nDespite his many setbacks, Lee continued to pursue his vision for k-pop.\n“It is a story of determination and persistence and really having a vision and a dream and sticking to that dream and being able to pivot too,” said Poo.\nSurreal documentary scenes where Lee speaks against a virtual background were part of the director’s vision from the beginning.\n“Those scenes are meant to represent his imagination, they’re internalized dream sequences,\" said Poo. \"The audio is lifted from our interviews, but there are more thoughts that reflect his creative imagination and his own hopes and dreams. I really wanted to take the opportunity to create something that was more dreamlike and did more artistic justice to these very deep thoughts that he conveyed to me in our interviews.’\nIn the documentary Lee describes k-pop as being successful because it’s like bibimbap, a delicious Korean dish that combines various ingredients. His director agrees.\n“Because it is world music,” said Poo. “He collaborates with producers and talents from across the world, across genres, and mixes it all to his aesthetic. It incorporates our own library of sounds and things we love. He has a vast knowledge of music, so I think that with his engineer brain he has scientifically put these things together in a way that people will love and that brings joy. He has got this down to a science.”\nLee Soo Man: King of K-Pop airs on Prime on May 13.\n"

While some musicians are natural influencers, others are bad at TikTok, or just don't want to spend time there.\"Artists are not content creators,\" Sesh's CEO Pepe del Río told Business Insider. \"They create music and they like to perform.\"At its core, Sesh is a platform for artists to stay in touch with fans and manage data about their audiences.When users sign up to follow an artist on Sesh, they provide information like their age, location, and email. In exchange, they get notifications about album releases and other drops, the ability to chat with an artist or other fans during live sessions in the Sesh app, and an official \"fan card\" for that artist that lives in their mobile wallet (on iOS or Android), among other features.Sesh's artist roster includes pop stars like Anitta, Sofia Reyes, and the Black Eyed Peas.The company makes money by charging artists and their teams a monthly fee to use the platform. In the future, Sesh also plans to take a cut of fan transactions it helps facilitate.The company closed a $5 million seed round in September led by investment firm Miura Global. It's raised $7 million to date, including pre-seed funding from angel investors. Del Río's cofounders include Iñigo-Hubertus Bunzl Pelayo (COO), María José Guzman (CMO), and Andrés Fajardo (CPTO).Sesh is positioning itself as a superfan platform, tapping into a buzzy area of the music business and broader creator economy. The company is playing in a crowded marketplace of fandom startups, including text-marketing tools like Community, membership apps like Patreon, and music album drop platforms like Laylo.So, how did Sesh differentiate itself to investors in its most recent fundraise?It uses mobile wallet \"fan cards\"Ultimately, the company wants its users not to feel tethered to a particular app, but instead follow an artist no matter where they are posting content. That's where the mobile wallet \"fan card\" comes in.\"When you talk about a community app, normally an investor will look at you and say, 'Who the f—k is going to download a community app,'\" del Río said.The wallet card, by contrast, is simple to download and a useful tool for artists to send push notifications to fans, he said. Music fans are already accustomed to keeping concert tickets in their mobile wallets, so why not get artist updates there, too?It's positioning itself as a data companyInvestors often bet on startups with a smart data story, and Sesh is positioning itself as a data company that allows artists to track fan analytics and spot trends that can help them make money from their audiences.Sesh's founders are bullish on AI and want to keep their team smallAt a moment when Big Tech executives are weighing whether to use AI to reduce their company's head count, new startups can make bets from the start on how automation will impact their team's size.Del Río said he doesn't want to grow his team any bigger than it needs to be, and that AI is already helping the company work more efficiently (which investors appreciate) in areas like coding and marketing.Read the pitch deck that Sesh used to raise its seed round:Note: Two slides were removed that contained information about the company's clients in order to share the deck publicly.\n            \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          It opens with a title slide\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                                \n                                  Sesh.\n                                  \n                            \n                          \n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          The superfan opportunity\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                                \n                                  Sesh.\n                                  \n                            \n                          Sesh combined data from Nielsen, Live Nation Entertainment, and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, among other sources, to provide some top-level estimates of the market opportunity.This slide reads:Artists struggle to manage and monetize their fan communities, while fans crave deeper connections$14.6BN unrealized fans higher spending$15.4BN wasted chasing fans the old way+80% of total expenditure comes from superfans\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          There are millions of artists to recruit\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                                \n                                  Sesh.\n                                  \n                            \n                          Sesh estimated that music industry fan communities are a $34.5 billion market opportunity.

    "full_text": "Ha Yoo-joon, Park Ji-hu and Lee Seung-hyub star in 'Spring of Youth.'Viki.com\nSpring of Youth is a k-pop k-drama that offers pop star romance, musical duels and a melodic mystery. This entertainingly escapist and sometimes appealingly silly romcom is focused on a rock star, Sa-gye, whose dreams all seem to have come true.\n\n\nHe’s the much-adored leader of the band The Crown and he sometimes acts without thinking. Sa-gye has always wanted to be a star and worked diligently to achieve his goal, overcoming a major physical injury that almost cost him his sight. Despite this drive to succeed he repeatedly gets himself in trouble and is eventually bumped from the band. While suspended he decides to attend college, but studying quietly alongside his fellow students is not that easy. He expects adulation and he gets some of that, but he also gets a reality check and is forced to rearrange his priorities.\n\nSa-gye is played endearingly by Ha Yoo-joon, who recently debuted in the drama Namib and is a member of the new idol band AxMxP. The rookie actor shines brightly while playing the disgraced-yet-optimistic pop star prince. Despite getting kicked out of the band the character is clueless about how badly he’s messed up.\n\n\nThere’s a music major attending his school and he can’t stop thinking about her. That student, Bom, is also a songwriter. Sa-gye becomes intrigued when he hears the music her locket plays. It’s the song he’s been hearing in his dreams. The talented Bom is played by Kim Ji-hu, who played the youngest sister in the drama Little Women and appears in the films Concrete Utopia and House of Hummingbird. Bom is a pretty serious student and can’t imagine why Sa-gye might pursue her and ask her random questions, like “what song is that?”\n\nBom already has a suitor, med student and musical genius Tae-yong, played by Lee Seung-hyub who previously appeared in Love Next Door and Lovely Runner. Tae-yong is determined to keep Sa-gye away from Bom, but music winds up complicating everything. The music is part of the mystery that needs to be solved in Spring of Youth. Sa-gye is drawn to the song on Bom’s locket and hears it in his dreams because it relates to an incident he can’t completely remember. The mystery not only involves Bom and Sa-gye; it also involves someone Sa-gye looks up to.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nBom’s sister Gyu-ri, played by Seo Hye-won (When Life Gives You Tangerines, Love Scout, Lovely Runner), is a comically enthusiastic fan of The Crown, so she becomes Sa-gye’s cheerleader at school.\nThis drama has plenty of k-drama tropes—fated lovers, mismatched roommates, childhood trauma, extraordinary man loves ordinary woman—but it doesn’t ask viewers to take them too seriously and the bright fresh-faced cast makes these tropes easier to accept, even enjoy. Like all fated k-drama lovers, Bom and Sa-gye met when they were children, but will they remember what the circumstances were? Their romance proceeds in soft focus with a soundtrack of accelerated heartbeats and musical interludes, as well as pretty camera shots of raindrops flashing in the sun.\n\nSpring of Youth, an SBS drama, is directed by Kim Sung-Yong, who directed the historical drama My Dearest, It airs on Viki.com in the U.S.\n\n\n\n"

(Photo by Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images)Billboard via Getty Images \nLisa earns a brand new radio hit in America this week. The Blackpink musician lends her talents and her fame to \"Priceless,\" the latest single from Maroon 5. The tune gets off to a strong start on two of Billboard’s three pop airplay tallies. As it arrives, Lisa breaks out of a tie with one of her bandmates and matches an all-time record among K-pop musicians.\n\n\nLisa’s New Adult Pop Airplay Chart Win\n\"Priceless\" launches at No. 17 on the Adult Pop Airplay chart. The cut instantly becomes Lisa’s third track to reach the ranking, which is focused on the more mature side of pop. She has previously appeared on this list this year with both her own \"Moonlit Floor\" and \"Born Again,\" which also credits Doja Cat and Raye.\n\n\nLisa Matches BTS and Jung Kook\nNow that she claims three Adult Pop Airplay hits, Lisa ties for the most appearances among all K-pop acts. She’s currently on the same level as both BTS and Jung Kook, who beat her to this milestone.\n\nAmong those two names, BTS is the more successful. Two of its three placements rose into the top 10. \"My Universe,\" a collaboration with Coldplay, pushed to No. 8, while \"Dynamite\" peaked at No. 10. \"Butter\" only climbed as high as No. 14.\n\n\nJung Kook, one of the seven musicians that make up BTS, saw \"Left and Right,\" his duet with Charlie Puth, soar to ninth place. As a frontman, his own \"Seven\" with rapper Latto climbed to No. 19, while \"Too Much,\" fronted by The Kid Laroi and also featuring rapper Central Cee, stalled at No. 22 last year.\nMORE FOR YOU\nLisa Breaks Her Tie With Rosé\nBefore \"Priceless\" arrived, Lisa was tied for the record for the most Adult Pop Airplay wins among K-pop’s solo female musicians – an honor she now solely claims. She was matched with Rosé, her Blackpink bandmate, who has seen both \"Apt.\" with Bruno Mars and \"Toxic Till the End\" spend time on the tally.\n\n\n\n“Priceless” is a Hot 100 Smash\n\"Priceless\" also manages to launch on the Pop Airplay chart, where it kicks off its time at No. 26. Lisa has now seen five tracks under her own name place on that tally. The Maroon 5 collaboration also brings her back to the Hot 100, as the poppy cut enters at No. 76, rounding out her half-dozen smashes.\n"

    "full_text": "Forbes Asia\nFrom K-pop and P-pop bands to medal-winning Paralympians, there is no shortage of star power on this year’s 30 Under 30 Asia list.\n\nBack in February, BINI, the eight-girl pop sensation from the Philippines, kicked off its 15-city world tour with a sold-out concert at home, packing excited fans into the 50,000-seat Philippine Arena north of Manila. Short for “binibini”—or young woman in Tagalog—BINI is the brainchild of Philippine media company ABS-CBN, which, inspired by the global popularity of South Korean girl groups, selected members Gweneth Apuli (Gwen), 21; Maraiah Queen Arceta (Aiah), 23; Sheena Mae Catacutan, 20; Mikhaela Janna Lim (Mikha), 21; Mary Loi Yues Ricalde (Maloi), 22; Jhoanna Chritine Robles, 20; Stacey Aubrey Sevilleja, 21; and Nicolette Vergara (Colet), 23; in 2019 from 250 aspirants following a nationwide talent search.\n\nThe octet form one of the entries on this year’s star-studded Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia: Entertainment & Sports list, who are making waves in the music and entertainment industry.\n\"Our posts show who we really are... and that's one reason our fans like us.\"\n\nIn K-pop style, the young trainees, under the management of ABS-CBN, spent the next three years living together and training every day. “It’s mentally, emotionally, and physically draining,” says Sheena, the main dancer. The pandemic also took its toll, according to main vocalist Maloi, preventing them from visiting their families. When the network lost its broadcast license in 2020 in a political spat, the group was spared the chopping block amid company layoffs.\nForbes Asia\n\nIn 2021, BINI released its title track “Born to Win,” an anthem about empowerment, from its debut album, which has since racked up over 100 million streams on Spotify. The group’s first solo concert in Cubao, one of Metro Manila’s oldest commercial hubs, sold out in under two hours in 2024, prompting the addition of two more shows.\n\nFrom then on, BINI raced to the top. Last year, it won Best Asia Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards and Billboard K Power 100’s Voices of Asia award at its Seoul event. In March, Billboard Philippines named the eight members its Women of the Year as their top songs surpassed a billion streams on Spotify. BINI’s most-viewed video on YouTube, “Pantropiko,” which loosely translates to “Tropical,” had amassed 105 million views at the end of April. “Salamin, Salamin,” or “Mirror, Mirror,” has attracted over 84 million views since its release last year.\nBuilding an online presence also played a major role in their rise. “At first, we were ignored, but then we noticed more public interest when we posted on social media” following the first album, says Mikha. The members shared their daily activities and thoughts, their favorite foods (pepperoni pizza, green mango with spicy shrimp sauce and stir-fried noodles, to name a few) and practical jokes (a video of Sheena making prank calls to Jhoanna and Aiah has over 2.4 million YouTube views).BINIJosh Tolentino_Artists & Company Manila for Forbes Asia\nIn particular, they weren’t afraid to describe their humble backgrounds and families’ struggles. All eight members come from low to middle-income families in the provinces.\nTwo grew up without fathers; another two had fathers working overseas. Gwen briefly quit due to the rigorous routine, while Sheena lost her mother during training and Jhoanna’s grandfather died. “Our posts show who we really are,” says Aiah, “and that’s one reason our fans like us.”\nSince its first album four years ago, BINI went on to release three more on pop themes like crushes, love and friendship. The group has also recorded some mature numbers, such as “Karera,” with its message of resilience—and promises more. “Our songs will evolve with our fans,” says Colet.\nK-pop Bands On The Rise\nBINI is the only girl group to make this year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list, while K-pop was represented by two boy bands.\nSouth Korea’s Stray Kids found global popularity by following their instincts, producing rock hits with a noisier, more industrial sound than the usual K-pop group. The 8-member group, formed in a reality TV show in 2017, debuted with their EP \"I Am Not\" in 2018, which quickly went platinum. Four years later, its EP \"Oddinary\" topped the Billboard 200, making Stray Kids the third only K-pop group to achieve that position, following boy bands BTS and SuperM. The group, included in 2023 on Time magazine's Next Generation Leaders list, performed in 2024 at the American Music Awards.K-pop band Stray Kids at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards.Penske Media via Getty Images\nAlso making waves is K-pop group Big Ocean, the first to be composed of members with hearing impairments: Kim Ji-seok, Lee Chan-yeon and Park Hyun-jin. Its agency, Parastar Entertainment, focuses on representing artists with disabilities. The group's vocals are recorded with the use of AI, and while performing on stage they wear special vibrating devices to help synchronize dance movements. The trio released the group’s first mini album in November 2024 and have over one million Instagram followers.\nParalympic Champions\nProving that physical disability is no barrier to excellence, paralympians from across the region demonstrated incredible athletic abilities and emerged victorious at recent global events.\nSheetal Devi became India's youngest Paralympic medalist after winning bronze in an archery team event at the Paralympics in Paris. Born without arms, Devi sits to hold the bow with her right foot, pulls the string taut with her right shoulder and then releases the string by unclenching her contracted jaw and shoulder. One of her coaches—inspired by another armless archer, Matthew Stutzman—helped create a special bow for her. Devi received the Arjuna Award, India's national sports prize, in 2023.Sheetal Devi of India competing at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.Sportsfile via Getty Images\nFrom Afghanistan, Zakia Khudadadi made history last year as the first athlete on the Refugee Paralympic Team to win a medal. Khudadadi's rise started in 2016 when she won the African International Parataekwondo Championship representing Afghanistan and then qualified for the 2020 Paralympics. In 2020 she became the second woman from Afghanistan to compete in the Paralympic Games since the event started in 1960, although she had to flee Taliban-controlled Kabul to compete. Now on the Refugee Paralympic Team, Khudadadi took bronze in the women's 47kg category in Paris 2024.\nRead our complete Entertainment & Sports list here – and be sure to check out our full Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia 2025 coverage here.\n30 UNDER 30 ASIA RELATED ARTICLESForbesThe Changemakers  And Activists On The 30 Under 30 Asia Social Impact 2025 ListBy Rana Wehbe WatsonForbesHealthcare & Science: Meet The Healthtech Founders And Scientists On The  30 Under 30 Asia ListBy Yue WangForbesThe 30 Under 30 Asia Fintech Founders And Investors Breaking Down BarriersBy Cat WangForbesMeet The Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Class Of 2024By Rana Wehbe Watson"

Lisa of BLACKPINK at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards held at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024 in in Elmont, New York.  (Photo by Gilbert Flores/Billboard via Getty Images)Billboard via Getty Images \nWhen Maroon 5 and Lisa's single “Priceless” hit Billboard's radio charts, it immediately became clear that the two musical acts had produced a sizable winner together. The tune was quickly adopted across a number of pop formats, becoming not only an instant charting success, but a major hit.\n\n\nThe single is currently in its second frame on two of the three tallies it currently appears on, and as it ascends, Lisa leapfrogs over some of the most successful names in K-pop history. While she still has a ways to go before matching the very biggest of the bunch, her progress – and after such a short period of time – is impressive.\n\nLisa’s “Priceless” Rises\n\n“Priceless” lifts on the Adult Pop Airplay chart from No. 17 — where it debuted last week — to No. 12. That’s an incredibly lofty position for a tune that has only spent two frames on the ranking, and it seems likely that it will crack the top 10 in just a few days when the company refreshes its rosters.\n\nAs it climbs, “Priceless” now stands as the fifth-highest-charting track by any K-pop act in the history of the Adult Pop Airplay list. While Lisa was born and raised in Thailand, she is most closely associated with the South Korean music industry and K-pop, thanks to the fact that she got her start as one-fourth of Blackpink.\n\n\nLisa Beats BTS \nWhen “Priceless” arrived, it already stood out as the sixth-highest-rising win ever by a K-pop star on the Adult Pop Airplay chart. As it pushes five spaces north, the tune jumps over “Butter” by BTS, which stalled at No. 14 during its run several years back.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nBlackpink’s Rosé is Still Winning\nFellow Blackpink singer Rosé still claims the highest-rising win ever among K-pop musicians on the Adult Pop Airplay chart. Her collaboration with Bruno Mars, “Apt.” peaked at No. 2. This week, that cut is still going strong at No. 9.\n\n  \nThe next-highest-climbing tracks by K-pop acts on the same radio list are “My Universe” by Coldplay and BTS (No. 8 peak), “Cupid” by Fifty Fifty (No. 9) and “Dynamite” by BTS (No. 10).\nLisa’s Single on all of Billboard’s Pop Radio Charts\n“Priceless” also pushes to a new peak on the Pop Airplay chart this frame. It jumps four spots to No. 22. At the same time, it arrives on the Adult Contemporary tally, coming in at No. 29.\n"

    "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbenjamin/2025/05/30/cosmosy-speak-on-y2k-inspirations-being-6th-generation-k-pop-idols/",
    "full_text": "cosmosySony Music Entertainment Korea\nAs part of Spotify’s celebration for May’s Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month this month, the streaming service hosted an event at its New York headquarters with an industry panel of Asian-American execs, a spread of pan-Asian street food, a DJ set from Angie, and the debut U.S. performance from the new girl group cosmosy, who are helping usher in a new era of global-pop to the world.\n\n\nCreated by BLACKPINK’s former creative director at YG Entertainment SINXITY, cosmosy is the female quartet that is only two singles into their careers but already making moves around the world. The cosmosy members Amei, Kamión, Himesha, and De_Hana all hail from Japan but were trained in Korea under the K-pop system and sing in a mix of English, Japanese and Korean, all appealing to the mainstream music market. As further proof of their blended pop-culture backgrounds, De_Hana and Kamión initially rose to recognition after competing on Produce 101 Japan The Girls, a local spin-off of Korea’s Produce 101 singing competition series that created chart-topping acts like IZ*ONE and Wanna One. The show provided them with early opportunities to get comfortable on stages where their fellow K-pop and J-pop idols would perform.\n\nBringing together expertise across two of the world’s largest music markets, the entertainment wing of major Japanese mobile carrier NTT Docomo Studio & Live teamed with Sony Music Korea in partnership exclusively for cosmosy. Local representatives from Sony Music and The Orchard, as well as publicists around the world, are also supporting the group with an attentive crew overseeing the girls in New York. A beautiful blend of voices speaking in English, Japanese and Korean surrounds the quartet, ensuring the group has handheld fans to cool down with after performing or ensuring their selfie lighting is perfect with their phone’s own flashlight.\n\n\nWith such a specific worldview, cosmosy and their team have labeled the group as the first act in the “sixth-generation of K-pop.” While there’s debate among fans and critics about what defines a new generation of Korean-pop acts, it’s generally agreed upon that the fifth era of K-pop idols began around mid-2023 as major labels debuted their latest artists like ZEROBASEONE, xikers and BABYMONSTER. With cosmosy’s buzz single “zigy=zigy” released on December 31, 2024, and official debut single “Lucky=One” dropping this April, the group has made a bold declaration that not only zooms into a new era of K-pop but showcases how the definition of the music scene is expanding in exciting ways.\n\nMixed with the excitingly artistic and creative styling that goes into cosmosy’s visuals for their mass-appeal pop music, it all comes together in an exciting way of envisioning pop music’s future as so many people work together towards one goal, blending different styles, cultures and languages.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nLearn more about cosmosy, their inspirations, and take on the new generation of K-pop below.\nJeff Benjamin: Congratulations on the release of “Lucky=One.” How does it feel to have made your debut while busy with promotions?\nhimesha: Now that we are participating in promotions, it is starting to feel like we actually debuted.\n\nde_hana: We are very busy, but we enjoyed and are enjoying every moment of it.\nJeff Benjamin: Fans took notice of the very strong visuals and live performances for “Lucky=One.” How have your experiences been?\n\n\na’mei: I’m very happy that our fans noticed us as cosmosy. We were also able to meet other idol fans and it made me realize that I want to work harder and let more people know about us.\nhimesha: In my case, the happiest thing is that I found one of my fans in the audience holding my name board during the music shows, and I was glad I noticed it with so many other fans [in the crowd]. Even now, it feels like a dream that it happened.\nkamión: Through this “Lucky=One” promotion, our fans and followers increased — it was more than expected. I was amazed and surprised.\nJeff Benjamin: While we know de_hana and kamión have TV experience from Produce 101 Japan, how did that compare to the live music shows?\nkamión: Back when we were on Produce 101 Japan, we had the chance to perform on the same stage as M Countdown in Korea. But this time, I stood there as a member of cosmosy on the actual M Countdown music show; the experience felt different. Previously, there were eight members on stage, while now it’s just four, so I felt more attention was on each of us individually. I was nervous and excited.\nde_hana: It had been a while since I was back on that same stage. During Produce 101 Japan, I was more focused on improving myself, and I think my fans are starting to recognize how much I’ve grown since then. With cosmosy, I feel a real sense of belonging as part of a team, like we’re one unit. But back then, the others felt more like rivals than teammates.\nJeff Benjamin: You also met fans while working in Korea. How was that experience?\na’mei: Meeting my fans for the first time was when it really hit me: “I’ve debuted as a member of cosmosy.” I was so excited. There were so many happy moments, like talking with fans and receiving gifts and handwritten letters. I’ve actually read one letter from a fan every day. It always moves me; sometimes, I get teary-eyed just reading.\nkamión: It was my first time meeting fans face-to-face in such a close setting and it made me so happy to see their smiles; that connection meant a lot to me. I have Japanese and global fans, too, so I really hope I can meet them soon. At our pop-up event, “Follow cosmosy in Seongsu,” one fan who’s supported me since Produce 101 Japan came to see me. She was shaking and crying while talking to me — her love was so heartfelt that I almost cried too.\nhimesha: Seeing my fans in person and hearing their words of support made me feel even more emotionally connected to them. I was especially touched when I saw name boards during our music show performances or when fans came running to see us after we finished performing. My fans come to every broadcast and cheer us on — one even cried when she met me at our pop-up event. That moment was deeply moving to me.\nde_hana: I met both Japanese and Korean fans at our pop-up event, “Follow cosmosy in Seongsu,” and the letters I received were filled with kind words that gave me so much strength and motivation to keep going. One fan made a keyring included with her handwritten letter. They also showed me the same penguin plushie I had with me during my Produce 101 Japan audition. I remembered them right away and I was so grateful to reconnect.\nJeff Benjamin: I read an interesting article reporting you define cosmosy as a “sixth-generation K-pop act.” Can you explain this a bit more?\nkamión: cosmosy uses the term “sixth generation” to emphasize a distinct identity from fifth-generation idols.\nJeff Benjamin: Are there other artists you consider to be sixth-generation?\nkamión & a’mei: We will be known as the first sixth-generation K-pop idols, so we will work hard and strive to be better!\nhimesha: cosmosy features a unique worldview based on the “end-of-the-century” [Y2K] vibe of 1999, combined with a multi-layered content strategy that resonates with Gen Z and Gen Alpha. This sets us apart from the simpler narrative-based worldviews of past K-pop groups, offering a new idol model that combines fan participation and immersive storytelling.\nJeff Benjamin: Speaking of that time, cosmosy’s content reminds me of some classic anime or mangas. Can you share any favorite childhood anime or suggest some for fans?\nhimesha: I love Tamagotchi, it’s an animation and a game you can play on the Nintendo. But a recommendation I want to make is The Promised Neverland. It’s really fun, in the fantasy genre, and there’s even a movie!A \"Tamagotchi\" electronic pet toy is displayed in a toy store on October 25, 2017 in Paris, France. ...

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)Getty Images\nLike her three Blackpink bandmates, Jennie released a solo album not long ago, right before the group began rehearsing for its world tour, which is set to kick off later this year. The superstar dropped Ruby in March, and the set didn’t just earn a lofty debut and then disappear — it has been holding on for months now in America.\n\n\nAs the set manages one more stay on an important albums ranking, the woman behind it joins a very exclusive club.\n\nJennie’s Ruby is Falling on the Billboard Charts\nRuby drops nearly 40 spaces on the Billboard 200 this week. The full-length, which shifted another 8,800 equivalent units, according to Luminate, dips from No. 159 to No. 192 on the ranking of the most consumed full-lengths and EPs in the country.\n\n\nWhile it's very much on the decline, it’s the length of time that Ruby has managed on the Billboard 200 that is important and noteworthy.\n\nJennie’s Album Joins an Exclusive Club\nAs of this frame, Ruby has spent 10 weeks on the Billboard 200. It is just the fourth album in U.S. history to rack up double-digit stays on the competitive roster, when looking only at K-pop soloists.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhen narrowing that view to female solo K-pop acts, two of the four members of Blackpink make the cut. Rosé’s almost self-titled Rosie is in a distant first place among this small collection. That set, which is also still present on the Billboard 200, has now spent 23 frames somewhere on the tally.\nJimin Leads all K-Pop Soloists\n\nHis BTS bandmate Jung Kook claims the second-longest charting title among all K-pop soloists on the Billboard 200. His only solo full-length Golden made it to 25 turns on the tally before slipping away.\n\n\nRosé is Catching Up to Jung Kook\nRosé’s Rosie is being powered largely by the single \"Apt.,\" her collaboration with Bruno Mars. That tune is still present on not just the Hot 100, but also the Streaming Songs, Radio Songs, and Digital Song Sales charts this week. If consumption of that smash — as well as the project in full — continues, Rosie could tie Jung Kook’s Golden in just two weeks and match as the second-longest charting album by any K-pop soloist in the history of the Billboard 200.\n"

    "description": "With a 9.7% stake, Tencent’s online music arm will become the second-largest shareholder of SM Entertainment, known for major K-pop acts such as Aespa and NCT.",
    "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/catzxwang/2025/05/28/tencent-music-buys-177-million-stake-in-k-pop-giant-sm-entertainment/",
    "full_text": "SM Entertainment's K-pop girl group Aespa at a media showcase in Seoul, South Korea.Han Myung-Gu/WireImage\nChinese billionaire Ma Huateng’s tech giant Tencent is set to acquire a nearly 10% stake in K-pop agency SM Entertainment from billionaire Bang Si-hyuk’s rival agency Hybe, as thawing relations between China and South Korea have signaled a potential rise in demand for Korean cultural exports.\n\n\nTencent Music Entertainment Group, Tencent’s online music arm, will purchase Hybe’s 2.2 million shares in SM Entertainment for 243 billion won ($176.6 million), according to a Hybe corporate filing Tuesday. The shares, which Hybe will dispose of in an after-hours block trade on May 30, are priced at 110,000 won apiece, representing a discount of roughly 15% from their price of 130,000 won at Tuesday’s market close.\n\nUpon the sale, Tencent Music will hold a 9.7% stake in SM Entertainment, making it the second-largest shareholder of the K-pop agency after billionaire Kim Beom-su’s Kakao and its entertainment affiliate. The Korean internet giant owns a combined 41.5% stake in SM Entertainment, between Kakao Corp. (with 21.6%) and its subsidiary Kakao Entertainment (19.9%). Tencent also owns a 5.95% stake in Kakao Corp.\n\nHybe stated in its filing that the purpose of its share sale is “optimizing investment asset management efficiency.” Tencent Music and SM Entertainment did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Amid recent tariff turmoil, K-pop industry remains defensive and relatively insulated from direct tariff risks,” researchers from Global X, an ETF provider of Mirae Asset Global Investments, wrote in a monthly commentary report published last Tuesday. “Furthermore, the sector stands to gain from improving Korea-China relations, as the potential reopen of China market could unlock significant growth opportunities.”\nOther factors, including the comeback of leading artists and the rise of new ones, could also play a role in improving the industry’s fundamentals, the researchers added. SM Entertainment, in particular, may expect to benefit from “upcoming releases from key artists such as Aespa, NCT WISH, and RIIZE.” Hybe’s world-record-shattering boy band BTS, which has scored six No. 1 albums on the U.S. Billboard 200, may reunite as early as this June upon the seven members’ completion of their mandatory military service.\nHybe's K-pop boy group BTS attending the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\nTencent Music’s latest investment aligns with rising hopes across the entertainment industry that Beijing may lift its unofficial ban on K-pop performances. Following Seoul’s 2016 decision permitting the U.S. military to deploy a missile defense system in South Korean airspace, Chinese regulators effectively barred K-pop concerts from taking place in the mainland, while also restricting streaming platforms from releasing Korean-language TV shows and movies.\nThe first sign of detente came in late April, when Epex, a K-pop boy band managed by C9 Entertainment, announced on April 30 it would perform a concert in Fuzhou, the capital city of China’s southeastern province of Fujian. But less than two weeks later, on May 10, the concert was indefinitely postponed, with C9 Entertainment citing unspecified “issues” in the region.\nReopening China’s borders to K-pop performances could be a boon to major agencies, which rely on ticket and merchandise sales as key revenue streams. SM Entertainment reported its revenue reached 231.4 billion won in the first quarter, with concert revenue rising 58% year-over-year to 39 billion won.\nBeyond live events, K-pop agencies are increasingly monetizing fan engagement, chiefly through apps that offer paid subscriptions for fans to directly message celebrities or join exclusive livestreams. Tencent announced last October it would partner with an SM Entertainment subsidiary, DearU, to launch its fan engagement app, Bubble, in China. Slated to enter the market by June, Bubble may face steep competition from other popular apps like Hybe’s Weverse, which announced in April that it reached 9.4 million monthly active users and 150 million cumulative downloads by the end of 2024.\nThe share purchase marks Tencent’s solidified role among Korea’s leading “Big 4” music agencies—Hybe, JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment—with each agency distinguished by a handful of marquee acts. Tencent Music owns a 4.3% stake in YG Entertainment, known for its landmark girl group Blackpink, which made the 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2019; JYP’s artists include girl group Twice, which made the list in 2020, and boy group Stray Kids, which made the list this year.\n\nMORE FROM FORBESForbesFrom BINI To Sheetal Devi: Meet The Breakthrough Stars And Athletes On The 2025 30 Under 30 Asia Entertainment & Sports ListBy Rana Wehbe WatsonForbesA Decade Of 30 Under 30 Asia: Meet Some Of The Most Successful AlumniBy Cat WangForbesAs Tencent’s New Games And Shows Draw Fans In Droves, Founder Pony Ma Reclaims Title Of China’s Second Richest PersonBy Catherine Wang"

    "full_text": "Rosé’s “Apt” holds on the Hot 100 for a thirty-first week, tying Psy’s “Gangnam Style” as the ... More third-longest-charting K-pop song in U.S. history.   LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 04: Rosé attends the 2023 LACMA Art+Film Gala, Presented By Gucci at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 04, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for LACMA)Getty Images for LACMA \nRosé’s single “Apt.” is pushed down on the Hot 100 this week as the ranking is dominated by tracks from Morgan Wallen’s new album I’m the Problem. The country superstar fills 36 spots on the busy tally, and his influx sends a handful of tunes off the list, and that reshuffling forces some major long-standing successes to drop.\n\n\nThe Blackpink singer manages to hold on once more, and as expected, her collaboration with Bruno Mars earns another stay on the Hot 100. As of this frame, she ties an important record and comes within striking distance of a historic figure.\n\nRosé Ties a Major Hot 100 Record\n\n“Apt.” has now spent 31 weeks on the Hot 100. It reaches that milestone as it dips from No. 22 to No. 28 on the list of the most popular tracks in the country. As of this period, “Apt” is tied with “Gangnam Style” by Psy as the third-longest-charting tune by any K-pop act in American history. That catchy smash helped introduce millions to the genre more than a decade ago and ignited the K-pop craze that continues today.\n\nJimin Still Leads\nJimin owns the all-time record for the longest stay on the Hot 100 by any track from a K-pop star. His single “Who” debuted in mid-2024 and lived on the ranking for 33 weeks. Somewhat surprisingly, it only climbed to No. 12 and never managed to break into the top 10.\n\n \nJust one frame behind “Who” comes “Dynamite” by BTS, the band that launched Jimin to stardom. The pure pop tune hit No. 1 and remained on the list for 32 weeks, beating “Gangnam Style” by just one stint.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\nRosé May Soon Break Record\nThere’s a great possibility that “Apt.” will earn a thirty-second stay on the Hot 100 in just a few days — and it may even climb again as some of Wallen’s cuts fall away. It seems likely that Rosé could tie Jimin’s all-time record soon, and perhaps even beat it, as “Apt.” remains not just on the chart, but a hugely popular success at the moment.\n\n\nRadio is helping keep the tune alive these days. This frame, it lifts slightly to No. 21 on Billboard’s Radio Songs chart.\n"

(Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images)Variety via Getty Images \nLisa is back on the Hot 100 this week with an exciting new collaboration. The Blackpink superstar and solo musician joins Maroon 5 on “Priceless,” which is expected to serve as the first single from the band’s upcoming album.\n\n\nThis frame, the tune opens at No. 76 on the list of the most consumed songs in the U.S. As it arrives, Lisa advances again on the all-time ranking of the most successful K-pop soloists in American history.\n\nLisa’s Sixth Hot 100 Hit\n“Priceless” is Lisa’s sixth track to reach the Hot 100 under her own name. With one more win, she breaks her tie with Psy, who helped introduce K-pop to the world and currently matches with several other superstars.\n\n\nNow that she claims half a dozen placements on the Hot 100, Lisa is matched with her Blackpink bandmate Jennie for the most wins on the tally among K-pop solo female musicians. While Lisa is originally from Thailand, she is largely known in the music world for her K-pop output.\n\n\nLisa and Jennie Tie Jimn and V on the Hot 100\nBoth Lisa and Jennie are now on the same level as two singers from BTS. Jimin and V have also collected six smashes on the Hot 100 as soloists, and all four artists sit together in third place on the list of solo K-pop acts with the most Hot 100 wins.\nMORE FOR YOU\nJung Kook and J-Hope Lead the Charge\nTwo other BTS stars sit in first place and jointly claim the most Hot 100 smashes among K-pop solo artists, but the distance between the record and Lisa and company is not great. J-Hope and Jung Kook have both scored seven placements on the competitive tally. With just one more win, Lisa, Jennie, Jimin, or V could change this order once more.\n\nLooking at all K-pop acts, the ranking changes only slightly. BTS leads with 27 Hot 100 hits, and Blackpink comes in a distant second with nine.\nLisa’s Quick Radio Smash\n“Priceless” seems to be performing well on the Hot 100 thanks largely to quick adoption at radio stations across the U.S. The tune surely also brought in a healthy number of streams and sales, but it doesn’t manage to place on any of Billboard’s rankings dedicated to those forms of consumption. The Maroon 5 collaboration does, however, open on both the Adult Pop Airplay (No. 17) and Pop Airplay charts (No. 26) in the same week it debuts on the Hot 100, so it seems that airplay is largely responsible for its current success.\n\n\n"

Now, the world’s biggest K-culture festival amplifies that mission by announcing the addition of the X Stage, a dedicated live platform for rising talent at its upcoming Los Angeles event to bolster the lineup to a massive 33 artists.\n\n\nDubbed the “SHOWCASE on X Stage,” this stage will provide newly debuted idol groups and up-and-coming soloists the opportunity to perform for international fans, some on U.S. soil for the very first time. Throughout the festival’s August 1-3 dates, the LA Convention Center’s West Hall transforms into a special area to connect with these acts while also serving as a discovery zone for 10 artists leading a new wave of K-pop talent.\n\nThe Debut Lineup for KCON LA 2025’s X STAGE:\n\n 82MAJOR: The six-member boy band who debuted in 2023 and made their U.S. Billboard chart debut late last year with the release of their EP, X-82, following its release in the States\n NEWBEAT: The seven-member boy band from BEAT Interactive that made a major musical statement by debuting with their impressive full-length album, RAW AND RAD, this past March\n ifeye: A girl group whose name stands for “Imagine & Find, Energetic Young Eyes,” the sextet just arrived on the K-pop scene in April with their debut single “NERDY” released in Korean and English\n HITGS: The five-member girl group who also just debuted in April and dropped their first comeback single, “GROSS,” earlier this week\n Kik5o: A female soloist known for a distinctive sonic identity who dropped her latest single, “VITAL CHECK,” with fellow solo star and previous KCON performer AleXa in April\n from20, Hello Gloom, Lim Sejun, Kang Yunchan: A quartet of soloists under the WAY BETTER label, who each bring their own stylistic flair seen in singles from this year like from20’s “Eye Candy” and “Summer” by Lim Sejun.

One of the most notable instances came when BTS performed as the youngest artist on the lineup at KCON 2014 in Los Angeles. Billboard noted then that “BTS might have been the newest artist on the bill, but the huge crowd reaction could have made you think otherwise…we wouldn’t be surprised to see a U.S. tour announced soon.” Not only did the group announce a U.S. tour within a year, but multiple KCON appearances and touring the States would become a significant part of what created the band’s massive Stateside success.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nOther major artists like TWICE, SEVENTEEN, Red Velvet, Monsta X, NCT 127, Stray Kids, LOONA and more all made their first-ever appearances and performances in the States as part of KCON.\nTickets for KCON LA 2025 are now available via AXS, with additional announcements regarding special stages, guest appearances and convention programming all said to follow soon.\nKCON LA 2025’s X STAGE Daily Schedule Lineup (LA Convention Center West Hall)\nFriday (August 1, 2025)\n\n\n HITGS\n ifeye\n Kik5o\n NEWBEAT\n So Soo Bin\n\nSaturday (August 2, 2025)\n\n 82MAJOR\n HITGS\n Kik5o\n from20 & Hello Gloom & Lim Sejun & Kang Yuchan\n\nSunday (August 3, 2025)\n\n\n\n 82MAJOR\n ifeye\n NEWBEAT\n from20 & Hello Gloom & Lim Sejun & Kang Yuchan\n\n"

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 05: Rose attends \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\", the 2025 Costume Institute Benefit, at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)Getty Images\nRosé’s single “Apt.,” her collaboration with Bruno Mars, isn’t just another hit for the Blackpink singer. It’s much bigger than simply her most successful tune in the Unied States. The track is far and away one of the most commercially viable releases by any K-pop musician in American history. It has remained on a number of Billboard rankings for half a year, and nearly every frame, it ties a record or pushes a ceiling even higher.\n\n\nWhile “Apt” is slipping on some lists, it’s still climbing on at least one — and that’s enough to help the tune make history once again.\n\nRosé Rises on the Adult Contemporary Chart\nOn the latest edition of the Adult Contemporary chart, Billboard’s ranking of the cuts that reach the largest total audience via radio stations that focus on the adult contemporary subgenre of pop, “Apt.” pushes forward just one space, settling at No. 16. That’s not a new peak for the tune, but rather, the song returns to its all-time high on the ranking.\n\n\nRosé Ties BTS Again\nSixteenth place is the highest any K-pop act has ever climbed on the Adult Contemporary chart. The rise of “Apt.” helps Rosé once again tie with BTS’s “Dynamite” and “My Universe” with Coldplay, as both of those tunes also reached that spot several years ago.\n\nRosé’s “Apt.” with Bruno Mars Makes History\n“Apt.” is already the third-longest-charting tune by any K-pop star on the Adult Contemporary tally. It has now spent 15 weeks on the roster, but it needs to hold on for at least another month to match the 20 frames that both “Dynamite” and “My Universe” managed during their runs.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSince the tune is still sitting at its all-time high, it seems likely that it will remain on the chart for at least a few more weeks. “Apt.” could very well best both BTS cuts and stand out not just as the highest-peaking, but also longest-running success ever by a K-pop superstar.\n“Apt.” is a Hit Across a Number of Billboard Charts\nThis frame, “Apt.” continues to appear on eight other Billboard charts. Three of those are radio-focused rankings, and it remains a big hit on each of them. While it drops slightly on both the Radio Songs and Adult Pop Airplay tallies, it’s still living inside the top 20. At the same time, it keeps its position at No. 14 on the Pop Airplay list.\n\nThe lowest spot that “Apt.” reaches this frame in America is No. 25, which is where it sits on the Streaming Songs ranking. With such impressive staying power across the board, there’s a good chance Rosé and Mars will keep their surprisingly popular collaboration going on the Billboard tallies for a while.\n\n\n"

In the graphic, both candidates' heads bob furiously as they ride indoor bicycles, their vote share rising with each pedal stroke.For voters frustrated by the country's political turmoil, another sequence features a sound effect known in Korean as 'bbeong' -- the noise a fizzy drink makes when opened, or the thwack of a football, or the gurgle when a toilet is unclogged.- Rap battle -SBS is particularly well-known for its election graphics, but all South Korean networks do it -- with one rival channel going viral last year for a rap battle between candidates.\"It does make you wonder, can we go this far with people who might become the president?\" said Kim.But the journalists behind SBS's offerings say that the purpose of the graphics is to create a \"flow\" to engage viewers and keep them hooked on the democratic process.Early in the day while voting is underway, coverage is more restrained, but once exit polls are out \"we'll roll out fast-paced, high-energy items, with rapid-fire summaries to help viewers follow the evolving picture\", said Kim.\"We want people to look forward to our election night coverage, the way they anticipate a new film, thinking, 'I can't wait to see what they do this time'.\"Experts agree that graphics can help keep viewers -- and voters -- engaged.\"Eye-catching graphics could be valuable, if they serve to draw attention not just to visuals but to substantive content that helps elevate the political discourse in our country,\" Kim Seo-joong, a professor at Sungkonghoe University told AFP.hs/ceb/oho/fox"

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 02: Rosé attends as Tiffany & Co. celebrates the debut of the Tiffany Titan by Pharrell Williams Collection at Tiffany & Co. Landmark on May 02, 2024 in New York City.  (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Tiffany & Co.)Getty Images for Tiffany & Co. \nAfter Morgan Wallen inundated the Hot 100 last week with dozens of tracks from his new No. 1 album I'm the Problem, the tally becomes slightly less competitive this frame. Several of the country superstar’s tunes decline, making more room toward the top for a handful of smashes that had been performing incredibly well, but which fell when the singer-songwriter invaded the list – but they are now regaining ground.\n\n\nRosé’s hit “Apt.,” her hugely popular collaboration with Bruno Mars, is one such tune. It rises this frame as it makes space once more near the upper reaches of the ranking. As it does, the Blackpink singer ties the most successful group in K-pop history for a coveted spot in Billboard chart history.\n\nRosé’s “Apt.” Matches BTS on the Hot 100\n\n“Apt.” has spent 32 weeks on the Hot 100. The smash is now matched with “Dynamite” by BTS, which fell off the tally after 32 frames. It reaches that important milestone as it advances from No. 28 to No. 22 during a quieter period on the tally.\n\nRosé’s tune is now tied as the second-longest-charting track in U.S. history by a K-pop musician. Although originally from New Zealand, Rosé is closely associated with the K-pop style thanks to her career beginnings in Blackpink. Much of her output is at least partially related to that genre — including “Apt.,” which features both English and Korean lyrics.\n\n\nRosé Beats Psy’s Record\nJust last week, “Apt.” was on the same level as “Gangnam Style,” the first K-pop hit many Americans were familiar with. That track, which peaked at No. 2 more than a decade ago, racked up 31 stays on the Hot 100 and, for many years, reigned as the highest-charting and longest-lasting success by any K-pop artist in America.\nMORE FOR YOU\nRosé Will Likely Tie BTS Star Jimin\n\n“Apt.” now needs just one more frame to tie the all-time best showing by a K-pop star. That honor belongs to Jimin, one of the seven singers that make up BTS. He kept his tune “Who” on the tally for 33 weeks, starting in mid-2024. While Jimin’s track only climbed to No. 12, it remained on the list for months. Since “Apt.” is still present just outside the top 20, it seems likely Rosé will match Jimin’s showing — and may even beat it in time.\n\n\n"

    "full_text": "\n\tFrom Blackpink to White Lotus, the career of Thai singer, rapper, dancer, and actress Lisa is exploding. Now a documentary is in the works about Lisa’s past year when she took a break from the K-Pop group to go solo for the first time, while dazzling with her acting debut in the hit HBO drama (she also found time to perform at the Oscars and appear solo at Coachella).\n\n\n\n\n\tAward-winning filmmaker Sue Kim (The Speed Cubers, The Last of the Sea Women) is directing the film titled simply LISA. She tells Deadline she just completed the documentary’s final shoot with Lisa in South Korea, where the singer was reunited with Blackpink. Fresh from Seoul, Kim took part in Sony Music Vision’s first ever content showcase in Hollywood Thursday night, explaining her vision for the project.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve all seen Blackpink, we’ve all seen Lisa on stage. But I really wanted to get to know Lisa in her resting state and who Lisa is with her family and with her parents who she’s super close to,” Kim said in conversation with moderator Taylor Rooks. She added that Lisa proved open to allowing access to her inner circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLisa attends the 97th Annual Academy Awards on March 2, 2025 in Hollywood\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrazer Harrison/WireImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“She was actually texting her friend group from Bangkok, her childhood friends, and immediately just told them, ‘Hey, we’re coming to Bangkok. We’re making a film about my life. I want you to be part of it, and we just have to be how we are with each other,’” Kim recalled. “As soon as I found out that that’s the message she was sending them, I had a great feeling. I knew immediately that Lisa was a very willing participant in this story, which isn’t always the case with celebrity docs. And I knew that she would give us the access and the intimacy that not just I was hoping to get, but that I know that the world wants to see.”\n\n\n\n\n\tLisa, 28, was born Lalisa Manobal in Buriram, Thailand. She made her first appearance with Blackpink in August 2016; in the years since, BP has become the most successful female K-Pop group of all time.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLalisa Manobal as ‘Mook’ in ‘The White Lotus‘ Season 3\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of HBO Max\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“When Sony Music Vision first approached me about telling this story, I was immediately interested, not just because I have such an admiration for her, but I also knew the very specific place she was in life which was she was taking a hiatus from Blackpink for a year,” the filmmaker commented. “So many people in her position I think could have just taken a break, caught up on sleep, caught up with friends, or simply just stayed in their swim lane… I knew she was going to be premiering in her acting debut in The White Lotus, which she’d never acted before, and that’s an insanely visible, beloved TV series, and that takes a lot of guts, a lot of courage to make that your acting debut. I also knew she was going to be recording a solo album, and I knew that musically she was going to be stepping away from K-Pop and exploring her musical identity.”\n\n\n\n\n\tSony Music Vision is producing LISA in partnership with LLOUD CO./RCA Records and Tremolo Productions (the latter Oscar winner Morgan Neville’s company). At the showcase at Neue House, SMV also unveiled footage from Frank Marshall’s upcoming Barbra Streisand documentary, Baz Luhrmann’s film EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert, as well as details on a documentary in production that’s following Oasis musicians Liam and Noel Gallagher as they embark on a world tour.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tL-R Filmmakers Baz Luhrmann, Sue Kim, and Frank Marshall attend the Sony Music Vision content showcase\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy of Todd Williamson/Sony Music Vision\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Marshall Plan\n\n\n\n\n\tMarshall, a five-time Oscar nominee and Irving G. Thalberg Award winner known for Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Sixth Sense, Jurassic World, The Color Purple and much more, first encountered Streisand on a film set more than 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\t“I was Peter Bogdanovich’s assistant and location manager on What’s Up, Doc? in 1972, and that’s where I first met Barbara,” he said at the content showcase. “It was sort of a film school for me.”\n\n\n\n\n\tAlex Gibney is producing the Streisand project, with Marshall directing. The two previously collaborated on Sinatra: All or Nothing at All, with Gibney directing that and Marshall producing.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBarbra Streisand in a scene from ‘Funny Girl’\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Barbra had watched a documentary about Frank Sinatra that Alex and I did, and she was considering directors and producers for a documentary that she was doing. She was in the middle of writing her book [My Name Is Barbra],” Marshall recounted. “[Streisand’s manager] said, ‘Would you be interested, Alex?’ And Alex called me and said, ‘Hey, let’s go out and meet.’ And we did and we went out to Malibu, and we met Barbra and it went great. And so we decided to jump on the project and it’s been fabulous ever since.”\n\n\n\n\n\tThey’ve been immersed in Streisandiana maintained in a climate-controlled facility in Hollywood. “We’ve got to dive into this incredible archive that’s over here in Iron Mountain,” Marshall said. “Unbelievable. So, we’re very excited about putting this all together.”\n\n\n\n\n\tBreaking Baz News\n\n\n\n\n\tBaz Luhrmann could barely contain his excitement as he talked about EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert. The project continues his exploration of the King, which began with his 2022 narrative Elvis featuring starring Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker and Austin Butler as Presley.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElvis Presley publicity photo\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“I would’ve thought that Elvis had left my building by now,” he cracked. The Australian filmmaker said EPiC defies easy categorization. It’s “not specifically a documentary, nor a concert film: Elvis takes the audience through the journey of his life, weaving never-before-seen footage with iconic performances that have never been presented in this way, from the 1970 Vegas show, on tour in 1972 and even precious moments of the 1957 ‘gold jacket’ performance in Hawaii,” he said. “Most importantly, Elvis will sing and tell you about his life in first person, through both classic and contemporary musical prisms.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe footage he shared Thursday night shows the extraordinary power of Elvis’s charisma, his musicianship, and – how would one put it? – his interesting taste in performance attire. Some of his rhinestone-studded mini-capes, when flared, make him look like a flying squirrel.\n\n\n\n\n\tThe EPiC project grew out of his research on the Elvis narrative feature. “When I was making the film, I had heard of this probably apocryphal footage that existed of Elvis in the Vegas [International Hotel] show, maybe on tour. And I thought that maybe we could find it and reconstitute, actually use it in the movie,” he said. “I had the funds to get them to go and look for it in the salt mines and rather astonishingly… it not only existed, but we [also] found 59 hours of footage, including anamorphic 35, never before seen; 8mm [film], never before seen, from the ‘50s.”\n\n\n\n\n\tOnly problem? “There was no sound,” on it, Luhrmann said. “But what we were able to do, I’ve been with the wonderful Peter Jackson down in New Zealand, and he’s been so kind on this because he’s so brilliant at it, is we found [a way] to claw back the sound of some footage that you’ve seen. And we now know what he was saying in a lot of this footage.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t‘I Am: Celine Dion’\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon MGM Studios\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSony Music Vision is coming off a highly successful run of documentaries leveraging its artist roster and music library.

The Celine film turned into a huge success.\n\n\n\n\n\tTom Mackay, president of premium content for Sony Music Entertainment, told the showcase audience, I Am: Celine Dion “went on to become Prime Video’s most popular documentary ever.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Under Lee’s guidance, many of SM Entertainment’s earlier artists like H.O.T. (widely considered to be the first K-pop idol group), TVXQ!, BoA and Super Junior popularized K-pop in overseas markets and laid the foundations for K-pop to grow into a global phenomenon. As the documentary notes, beginning with its boy band EXO, SM Entertainment also introduced “concepts” (an overarching theme for an artist or one of their albums) and “universes” (fictional worlds built around a particular K-pop group that often involve elaborate storylines) into K-pop storytelling that became widely adopted across the K-pop industry over the years.\nLee Soo Man: King of K-Pop is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.ForbesOne Hundred Label, K-Pop Agency Behind THE BOYZ, Partners With Hello82By Regina Kim"

    "description": "The author of 'BTS: A Little Golden Book Biography' wanted to share their inspiring story with a younger audience.",
    "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2025/05/20/little-golden-books-first-k-pop-bio-takes-bts-from-dreams-to-stardom/",
    "full_text": "BTS is the first k-pop group to get its own Little Golden Books biography.Penguin Random House\nBTS are the world’s biggest k-pop band and they also have one of the world’s most loyal fandoms, the many millions of global fans called Army. During the course of their very successful career BTS have earned many accolades—including Billboard Awards, American Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards, Golden Disc Awards and several Grammy nominations—but 2025 is the first time the band will grace the cover of a Little Golden Book. Younger readers will be able to enjoy a bio of the k-pop band when BTS: A Little Golden Book Biography is released in the fall.\n\n\nIt’s fitting that the bio was written by Jan Ann, a children’s book writer and longtime BTS fan. Ann was introduced to the band by her daughter, who has been a BTS fan since 2013.\n\n“It was 2018, we were watching the Billboard Music Awards where they won the top social artists and performed ‘Fake Love’ for the first time,” said Ann. “After that I thought, well, they’re really amazing. So I started watching all their music videos and their performances and dance practices and live streams. They have so much content. And then we saw them in concert in 2019 during the world tour, the Love Yourself: Speak Yourself tour.”\n\nSomething about the performers’ personalities and the way they interacted with each other really resonated with Ann. There’s a lot she likes about k-pop in general, but BTS is now her favorite band and holds a special place in her heart.\n\n\n“I love that k-pop is just such a visual medium,” said Ann. “Well thought out concepts for everything. With BTS, there’s just a unique style and an aesthetic for every song that they have. And sometimes they’ll even have more than one concept for a song. It’s so fun to see what they’ll come up with next. I love their interactions with each other, their individual personalities, their sense of humor and all their content, such as Run BTS and In The Soop. And that's not even counting their amazing performances. The choreography that they have is so powerful.”(L-R) Jimin, Jungkook, RM, J-Hope, V, Jin, and SUGA of the K-pop band BTS on a past visit to the ... More \"Today\" Show in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/WireImage)WireImage\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAnn liked the band so much she wanted to share their story and considered ways to write about them for younger readers. One option was the Golden Books imprint, under Penguin Random House, which publishes biographies about interesting people from diverse backgrounds. Other Golden Book bios include Taylor Swift, Dolly Parton, Rihanna, the Beatles, Caitlin Clark, Simone Biles, Billy Porter, Michelle Yeoh, Carol Burnett, Jane Goodall, Jimmy Carter, Oprah Winfrey, Audrey Hepburn, Pope Francis, Chappell Roan and the Kelce Brothers. While the imprint published biographies in the past, the series really took off in 202o with a book about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The 2025 bio roster also includes books on Michael J. Fox, Serena Williams, Cher, and Rosa Parks.\n“When I saw the biographies,\" she said. “I thought that would probably be perfect.”\nHer biography follows the journey taken by BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook from their early days charting how they became one of the world’s biggest music groups, noting the success of songs like “Dynamite,” and mentioning career highlights, such as the time the band spoke at the UN about the power of young people to change the world. It was challenging to decide which parts of the band’s event-filled musical journey to fit in such a slim volume.\n\n“With all they have achieved, there’s so much content,” said Ann. \"So the book focuses on their early years, how they got their start together in South Korea and a few of the key points in their journey toward becoming the biggest music group in the world. It was hard to fit it all in, especially with the bios in the beginning with seven members. Each person gets a page. Then some of the highlights were speaking at the UN and performances such as when they first went to the AMAs in 2017 and performed “DNA” and then how that did so well on YouTube, how many views it had. Just a few key points of so many to choose from.\"\n\n\nAlready pre-orders for the BTS bio have bumped the title to the top of the yet-to-be-published Golden Book biographies list. Could it be parents who fondly remember buying Golden Books as a child that are ordering this title? That’s one possibility, said Ann.\n“I think there is a nostalgia factor since so many adults grew up reading the Little Golden Books,\" said Ann. “Many people have purchased them for themselves as a collector’s item. Also since the age range of Army is so great —from 2 to 102—there are Army parents, grandparents, teachers, caregivers, who may want to introduce BTS to the children in their lives through a simple storyline like a Little Golden Book. And with BTS’ journey being so inspirational, I think it's a positive story to share with others.”\nWhen Ann first became a fan, BTS was just becoming popular in the U.S. As a band and as solo performers, BTS are even more successful now, but, according to Ann, they have not let success change them.\n“It’s amazing how humble and generous they remain, as successful as they are,\" she said. “And I'm so excited for their comeback.”\nBy June all seven BTS members will have completed the mandatory military service required of able-bodied South Korean males. Although individual members have recently released music, the band has not performed together for a few years.\nThe BTS biography is the series’ first k-pop bio, but it won’t be the last. A biography of k-pop performers Blackpink is planned for December.\n“I think BTS are very inspiring role models for kids,” said Ann. “They worked hard to pursue their dreams and never gave up and have always remained incredibly humble and generous. And those are all qualities that would be inspiring to kids.”\nBTS: A Little Golden Book Biography was illustrated by Hyesung Park, an art director at Pixar Animation Studios.  The Golden Book bio hits the shelves on Sept. 2.\n\n"

Аппараты Galaxy S23 Ultra и S24 Ultra оснащены мощными светосильными объективами с 10-кратным оптическим зумом, которые обеспечивают фанатам качественные фотографии и видео с концертов. Аренда флагманского Galaxy обходится примерно в $25–$50 в день.\n\t\t\t\t\nИсточник изображения: unsplash.com\n\nСтандартный набор фаната, собирающегося на концерт любимой K-pop группы, дополнился непременным флагманским смартфоном Samsung. Подобные концерты нередко проходят на аренах, вмещающих более 16 000 человек, таких как Gocheok Sky Dome в Сеуле. В этом случае качественный зум-объектив смартфона имеет решающее значение для зрителей, сидящих далеко от сцены.\nПо крайней мере, дюжина известных компаний в Юго-Восточной Азии предлагают дневную аренду телефонов, таких как Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra и Galaxy S24 Ultra. Оба телефона, выпущенные в феврале 2023 года и январе 2024 года соответственно, оснащены объективами с 10-кратным оптическим зумом. Малые предприятия и частные лица арендуют телефоны для использования в день концерта по всей Юго-Восточной Азии. Но в Южной Корее — родине K-pop, где концерты проходят круглый год — рынок особенно горячий.\n\n\nОдной из компаний, предлагающих такую ​​услугу аренды телефонов, является Snapshoot, которая ежемесячно обслуживает сотни клиентов, в том числе из-за пределов Южной Кореи — из Японии, Малайзии и Индонезии. Ещё один игрок на этом рынке — южнокорейская телекоммуникационная компания Woori Mobile Service. Компании предлагает аренду моделей S23 и S24 по цене 35 000 вон или около $25 долларов в день.\nПо мнению руководителя одной из подобных компаний, «флагманские модели Samsung, такие как S23 Ultra и S24 Ultra, предлагают исключительные возможности камеры и звука, особенно при слабом освещении и на концертах, что делает их идеальными для поклонников, желающих записать воспоминания в высоком разрешении».\nАренда телефонов компании — это временная мера для экономных фанатов, ведь многие не видят смысла покупать дорогой мобильный телефон, чтобы пользоваться им лишь в течение короткого периода. При этом поклонники K-pop, которые брали телефоны напрокат для концертов, говорят, что этот опыт стоил каждого потраченного цента.\nКонечно, смартфоны Samsung — не единственные телефоны с мощным зум-объективом. Google Pixel 9 Pro располагает 10-кратным оптическим зумом. Apple iPhone 16 Pro предлагает 5-кратный оптический и 25-кратный цифровой зум. Другие азиатские бренды, такие как Oppo, Huawei и Xiaomi, также оборудованы качественными камерами, способными снимать в сложных условиях.\nТем не менее, услуга аренды творит чудеса именно для имиджа Samsung. Эксперты полагают, что Samsung, вероятно, стал телефоном выбора, потому что у бренда огромная база поклонников на родине в Южной Корее. А маркетологи Samsung «куют железо, пока горячо» — смартфоны Galaxy объявлены «официальными телефонами K-pop», компания спонсирует концерты, демонстрирует в своей рекламе главных поп-идолов и выпускает специальные версии устройств.\n\n«Сдача в аренду телефонов Galaxy S23/S24 Ultra для концертов K-pop — это блестящий способ повысить репутацию Samsung, потому что вместо того, чтобы просто конкурировать по характеристикам, Samsung доминирует в нишевой потребности и превращает фанатов в послов бренда», — полагают аналитики.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\tИсточник:\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\t  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    Если вы заметили ошибку — выделите ее мышью и нажмите CTRL+ENTER.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tМатериалы по теме\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n"

Estos anuncios, con imágenes 'sugerentes' (en ocasiones robadas de Internet), prometían al usuario dirigirlo a vídeos 'XXX' y a 'shows en directo'...\n  \n\n...pero al hacer clic, los usuarios eran redirigidos a páginas web que no contenían el contenido prometido, sino que estaban saturadas de anuncios gestionados por Google, camuflados como resultados de búsqueda o portales informativos.\n\n     \n   \n   \n        (vía Indicator)\n   \n   \nUn ejemplo citado por Mantzarlis muestra una imagen de una mujer (en realidad, un icono del K-Pop) y el mensaje de \"Pulsa para ver película sin censura. Date prisa antes de que la borren\"; otro invita al usuario a \"hacer clic en cualquier palabra relacionada con 'abogado de divorcios'\" (arriba) para obtener acceso a un vídeo explícito.\n\n     \n   \n   \n        Los responsables de esta trama robaban anuncios de 'celebrities' para sus anuncios (vía Indicator)\n   \n   \nPor si no lo habías visto venir a estas alturas, todo resultaba ser una trampa diseñada para maximizar ingresos publicitarios manipulando al usuario para que visualice los anuncios programáticos de Google.\n \n\nUn negocio tan fraudulento como rentable\n\nAunque Meta no revela métricas completas sobre el alcance de estos anuncios, los datos públicos sobre campañas dirigidas a ciudadanos de la Unión Europea estiman que estos activos podrían haber sido vistos entre 50.000 y 20 millones de veces. En algunos casos, tal como revela el análisis de tráfico web de Similarweb, el 83% del tráfico mensual de una de las webs promocionadas provenía directamente de Facebook.\n\n   \n     \n    \n   \n   \n  \nEl 'modus operandi' es muy simple: atraer al usuario con un contenido explícito ficticio, dirigirlo a una página con textos generados por inteligencia artificial como relleno, y bombardearlo con anuncios publicitarios automatizados. Y así los beneficios, tanto para los operadores del esquema como para las plataformas involucradas, se acumulan con cada impresión.\n\nEl rol de Meta y Google, en duda\n\nTras contactar Mantzarlis con ambas compañías, Meta eliminó todos los anuncios y páginas relacionadas, alegando que violaban sus políticas. Por su parte, Google procedió a desmonetizar algunos de los sitios involucrados.\n\nSin embargo, esta actuación meramente reactiva, y no proactiva, pone en entredicho a ambas plataformas: aunque ganan miles de millones de dólares a través de publicidad, al menos en este caso no han resultado ser eficaces para filtrar contenido fraudulento antes de que este alcance a millones de usuarios.\n \n\nImagen | Marcos Merino mediante IA\n\nEn Genbeta | Cada vez es más fácil encontrar a las mejores víctimas para cada timo: 'van a tiro hecho' gracias a la venta de datos personales\n\n \n "

    "description": "Mientras los misiles están en pausa, Corea del Norte y Corea del Sur libran un conflicto distinto: una guerra de información. USB, K-pop y series de Netflix contra represión, ejecuciones y teléfonos controlados. Y en esta batalla sin disparos, todo indica que…",

    "full_text": "\n              \n              \n              Aunque Corea del Norte y Corea del Sur firmaron un armisticio en 1953, nunca terminaron oficialmente la guerra. Hoy, el frente está en otro terreno: la información. No se disparan misiles, pero sí canciones pop, USB con series extranjeras y transmisiones clandestinas. En las últimas semanas, Corea del Sur reactivó los altavoces propagandísticos que apuntan al norte con música y mensajes sobre libertad. Al otro lado, Corea del Norte responde con himnos militares a todo volumen. Es una especie de duelo sonoro, pero lo más intenso ocurre en silencio, bajo tierra o en la oscuridad de la noche. Las armas: dramas coreanos, memoria USB y ondas de radio © İrem Çilingir – Pexels Desde hace años, activistas y desertores envían USB con contenido prohibido: dramas de Netflix, canciones de BTS, tutoriales sobre democracia. Estos dispositivos cruzan la frontera en cajas de fruta o flotan por los ríos, burlando cercas y patrullas.\n\n Organizaciones como Unification Media Group crean cuidadosamente listas con dos tipos de contenidos: entretenimiento “seguro” y material educativo altamente prohibido. Lo primero inspira curiosidad, lo segundo, peligro.\n\n Y funciona. Muchos desertores aseguran que estas series fueron su despertar. Ver libertad, riqueza y posibilidades en la pantalla los llevó a cuestionar el sistema y, en algunos casos, a huir.\n\n «Lloré viendo una serie surcoreana. Me hizo soñar con otra vida», contó Kang Gyuri, una joven que escapó del norte en barco en 2023. Kim contraataca: ejecuciones, censura y vigilancia total © Thomas Evans – Unsplash El régimen de Kim Jong-un está al tanto del peligro que representa esta “invasión cultural” y ha respondido con dureza. Nuevas leyes ordenan penas de prisión e incluso la muerte para quienes vean contenido extranjero. Jóvenes son ejecutados por tener videos de K-pop en sus teléfonos.\n\n Además, «escuadrones de represión juvenil» recorren las calles. Castigan a quien use palabras con acento surcoreano, vista de forma «occidental» o hable de actores extranjeros. Los teléfonos norcoreanos incluso autocensuran palabras: si escribes “oppa” (hermano mayor, en estilo K-drama), el sistema lo borra o reemplaza.\n\n Y el contrabando se ha vuelto más difícil. Durante la pandemia, Corea del Norte reforzó la frontera con cercas eléctricas y nuevas patrullas. Ahora, solo los más valientes se atreven a cruzar información. Estados Unidos se retira… y Corea del Norte avanza © Micha Brändli – Unsplash La mayoría de las operaciones para informar a los norcoreanos han sido financiadas por el gobierno de EE.UU. Sin embargo, con el regreso de Donald Trump al poder, se suspendieron fondos clave a medios como Voice of America y Radio Free Asia.\n\n La excusa: reducir «gastos en propaganda radical». El resultado: Kim tiene menos enemigos en el campo informativo. Activistas advierten que, sin este apoyo, la guerra de la información se estanca. Y Corea del Sur no parece dispuesto a tomar la posta: el conflicto está demasiado politizado. El candidato presidencial favorito incluso prometió apagar los altavoces si gana las elecciones. Una esperanza persistente… aunque silenciosa Pese a la represión, los cambios culturales están sembrando algo. «El gobierno no puede borrar lo que ya está en la mente de la gente», dicen los activistas. Aunque aún no hay protestas masivas, hay algo nuevo: jóvenes que piensan distinto, que sueñan, que comparan. Y mientras los USB sigan flotando río abajo, la guerra silenciosa continuará.

(Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images \nLast week, Lisa returned to a number of Billboard charts as a soloist alongside Maroon 5. The pop band recruited the Blackpink superstar to lend some star power to its new single, and the plan worked.\n\n\n\"Priceless\" quickly became a hit across several pop radio formats. This frame, the tune debuts on yet another one of Billboard’s rosters dedicated to showcasing what pop cuts America is hearing on the airwaves. As it arrives, the singer and rapper matches one of the biggest names in the K-pop space in a very specific fashion.\n\nLisa’s New Radio Hit\n\"Priceless\" opens at No. 29 on the Adult Contemporary chart this week. It earns Lisa her second career win as a soloist on the tally. She first debuted on her own with \"Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me),\" which arrived only a few weeks ago in March and spent 10 weeks on the list before disappearing.\n\n\nLisa Matches BTS’s Feat\nLisa is just the second K-pop act to appear on the Adult Contemporary chart more than once — and she’s the first soloist to manage the feat. BTS became the first South Korean musical act to accrue a pair of wins, and then the first to snag three, several years ago. In 2021, the septet reached the ranking with \"Dynamite\" and \"Butter,\" as well as \"My Universe,\" the group’s collaboration with Coldplay.\n\n \nWhile Lisa is originally from Thailand, she’s most closely associated with the South Korean music industry and with K-pop. Much of her solo output can be classified under different pop subgenres, but since she got her start as a member of Blackpink, she’s usually considered a K-pop musician as well.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n“Priceless” With Maroon 5 is on the Rise\nAs it debuts on the Adult Contemporary chart, \"Priceless\" rises on both the Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay tallies, where it launched last frame. This time around, it jumps four spaces to No. 22 on the former tally and five spots to No. 12 on the latter list, coming in just below the top 10. There’s a good chance that, thanks to the popularity of the cut and Maroon 5’s impressive track record, the two may jump into the highest tier on the Adult Pop Airplay ranking in just a few days.\n\n\n"

It’s a little after 10 p.m. on Saturday when the star of the night, G-Dragon, is ushered onto the stage by a troupe of backup dancers. “I’m the GOAT, the living legend,” he boasts by way of introduction before easing into the explosive flow of his new track, “Power.” Tonight, the fashion maven is dressed in a lion-embroidered Gucci jacket, splotchy bleached jeans, and chunky loafers. By his second song, “Home Sweet Home” — featuring his fellow Big Bang bandmates Taeyang and Daesung who aren’t physically present at the festival but appear on the jumbo screen during their respective verses — he’ll remove his Balenciaga frames and black fedora to display freshly dyed pink spikes.\n          \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            A looming titan of K-pop, G-Dragon hasn’t stepped on an U.S. stage since 2017, and this is his first-time ever headlining a U.S. music festival. The historical significance of this show isn’t lost on this crowd which seems to be in a state of constant eruption. His 11-track set is fine-tuned to maximize this moment, wheeling through 2010s fan-favorites like “One of A Kind” and “Crayon” and tracks from his 2024 studio album Übermensch. When he plays his 2017 hype hit “Bullshit,” he remixes in segments of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” going as far to integrate the rapper’s iconic walk from the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show into his choreography. It feels like a statement on their mutual cultural standings, something that’s further underlined when he brings out surprise guest and former labelmate CL to perform 2009’s “The Leaders”: G-Dragon knows he’s an icon and has been an icon since his 2006 debut in the K-pop mega boy band, BIGBANG.\n          \n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n      Courtesy of Head in the Clouds\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n      Courtesy of Head in the Clouds\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Hours after the festival has wrapped I catch up with the industry-dubbed “King of K-pop” at the artist compound backstage where he’s makeup-free and unwinding with a glass of white wine. “I missed this vibe, especially at an outdoor festival,” he tells me in English. “It’s different from any of my concerts. Here, I feel like I can just chill.” \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            A few nights from now, he’ll be flying to Macau to continue his Übermensch world tour. “I’m sad because we had two songs left that we couldn’t play,” he says of tonight’s performance, noting that he “feels sorry” that he couldn’t perform more for his fans. Despite that, he says he feels more excited than ever to be back on stage. “[For] now, it makes me want to keep doing this.”\n          \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n      Courtesy of Head in the Clouds\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            If you were to ask G-Dragon’s fanbase even two years ago, they wouldn’t have expressed any hope of seeing him perform live again as he was deep into a seven-year hiatus that he recently was reawakened from in 2024. Fans probably could’ve said the same about Head in the Cloud’s other headliner 2NE1, who disbanded in 2016 and whose last U.S. performance was a surprise reunion at Coachella 2022 (also with HITC). Gravitas-filled, exhilarating showings was the theme of this year’s Head in the Clouds, 88rising’s annual music and arts festival that’s become an “Asian Coachella” of sorts in terms of scope and cultural impact. \n          \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Between energetic debuts — like that of the soon-to-be-massive Indonesian pop group No Na — and spots from emerging stars like Chinese-Canadian indie singer yung kai, Chinese-American singer Sunkis, and Thai rapper Milli, this year’s lineup showed off the rich and wide breadth of music being made by Asian, and Asian-descendant artists in music today. Korean powerhouses Dean and DPR Ian, who were among my most anticipated performers, allured crowds with heartstopping ballads and by taking their shirts off. But it was the fervent anticipation of G-Dragon and 2NE1’s appearances that defined the tone of the weekend. Decades after their debuts, their headlining performances marked a triumphant return to the forefront, and a resurgence of K-pop’s second generation.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      Seiji Oda at HITC 2025.\n    \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      Tabber at HITC 2025.\n    \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      yung kai at HITC 2025.\n    \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      MILLI at HITC 2025.\n    \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      DPR Ian at HITC 2025.\n    \n\n  \n       \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Unlike other music genres, K-pop defines their artists by cultural eras. K-pop’s second generation, spanning roughly from 2003 to 2012, was the one that pushed the genre into mainstream popularity, kicking off what’s now known as the Hallyu wave. That era introduced innovation, musical experimentation, and an influx of idol groups — among them BIGBANG and 2NE1, two forces that had such a colossal impact on the industry it wouldn’t be an understatement to say they created the blueprint of what we consider K-pop to be today. That HITC had two of K-pop’s most iconic forebears at one event felt like a reminder of their influence and record-breaking contributions. Like many of the 60,000 spectators who reportedly attended the festival, I showed up to see the artists who’d informed so much of my Korean pop culture knowledge, and my Korean heritage, as a pre-teen. And like many of the fans present, too, it was the first time I’d see either of them in the flesh.\n          \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Two hours before 2NE1’s set on day two, I pushed my way to the front to get a close-up view of the girl group who were my entry points into that world. At 8:15 p.m., members CL, Sandara Park, and Minzy bursted into a 12-song frenzy down nostalgia lane. The group’s fourth member, Park Bom, withdrew from the festival citing personal circumstances. But even with her absence, the trio enthusiastically carried on. When Bom’s absence was felt — her deep vocal range simply can’t be recreated — the gaps were filled by the crowd singing along. (“Sing it for Bom,” CL directed at the start of their set.) \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n      \n            They kicked things off with their 2009 debut song “Fire” before tackling their major hits in succession. Fans thrashed to “I Am the Best” and “Clap Your Hands,” while ballads “Ugly” and “Lonely” were belted at the top of our lungs. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear or two. As branded light sticks and fan merch waved high above in the final moments of 2NE1’s set, I realized that I’d just experienced a historic reunion of K-pop’s second generation icons that I’m not sure I’ll get to witness again.\n          \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  "

    "full_text": "KPOP Demon HuntersNetflix\nNetflix’s KPop Demon Hunters have released their trailer, and it’s safe to say, it’s poppin’!\n\nImagine if your favorite K-pop stars moonlit as demon hunters. While they’re killing it on the stage, they’re actually killing demons between comebacks and touring. The three idols – Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong), and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo) – from the group, Huntrix, use their secret identities as idols to protect their fans and the world from supernatural threats. The demons seem to have their own plans by utilizing that K-pop power and creating their demonic boy band, The Saja Boys– stealing hearts and souls.\n\n\nThe musical animated film, directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, sets the scene in Seoul, with Korean people at the center. In the trailer, several Korean ajummas (elderly ladies), fan girls and boys are seen in the crowd.\n\nKang told EW, “It was really my desire to see Korean people on film in animation. So it actually started off as just a demon hunter project where I wanted to showcase Korean demons. Because demon hunting is usually a side job that’s done in secret, it was like, what is their day job?”\n\nK-Pop Demon Hunters Official PosterNetflix\nProduced by Sony Pictures Animation, the same people who brought the Spider-verse films, the animations shown throughout the trailer are wild.

Top state officials, including Republican Governor Greg Abbott, have also launched investigations even though the project's developers say they're years away from breaking ground.   The East Plano Islamic Center – also known as EPIC – is a large mosque in Plano, a suburb north of Dallas. The mosque is running out of room as newcomers flock to the growing North Texas region.   A member of EPIC who is a realtor proposed a solution when he saw some land for sale – why not build another community to accommodate the growing Muslim population in North Texas?   \n   Growing community   Several of EPIC's members live within walking distance from the mosque.   Black and white houses with manicured lawns in the adjoining neighborhood are adorned with Arabic lettering. There's a grocery store up the road from the mosque called EPIC Market that sells halal meat and a Yemeni coffee shop, Haraz Coffee, which serves pistachio lattes and saffron milk cakes.   Fawzia Bilal lives close to the mosque. She says it makes it easier for her to integrate prayer into her daily routine. Muslims pray facing in the direction of Mecca, their holy land, five times a day. And holy periods like Ramadan call for additional prayer.   \"I'm able to do this without getting into traffic or thinking about jumping into a car, walking distance,\" Bilal said. \"I mean, it's all about honestly convenience and then the consistency with which we're able to practice our faith.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Plano resident Fawzia Belal stands near a projection of the future development of Epic City.\n                \n                    \n                    Yfat Yossifor/KERA\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Yfat Yossifor/KERA\n        \n    \n\n   \n   EPIC Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi told NPR the mosque is running out of space for its 10,000 members.   \"Why not build a purpose built community where all of the facilities, all of the amenities that people want are going to be within walking distance?\" Qadhi said.   EPIC purchased the land for the project about a year ago. The 402-acre development would be in unincorporated Collin and Hunt counties, roughly 40 miles northeast of Dallas.   \n   EPIC City would include a new mosque, more than 1,000 single and multi-family homes, a K-12 faith-based school, senior housing, an outreach center, commercial developments, sports facilities and a community college.   Qadhi said the first 450 plots for EPIC City sold out within days of its announcements on the mosque's website.   Future residents are purchasing shares to own a plot of land for future homes. In those purchases, there's a charge to help fund the construction of other buildings, like the mosque and school. Qadhi said that's how EPIC paid for the land, not external funding.   \"The funds came from the very people that are going to be living in that area,\" he said.   The probes   Although EPIC City has yet to file for construction permits, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and State Attorney General Ken Paxton have already launched several investigations of the project.   The state's probes include claims the project could be discriminating against non-Muslims in violation of the Texas Fair Housing Act, along with alleging potential financial harm to potential investors and potential violations of Texas consumer protection laws.   Abbott said in a press release that the Texas Workforce Commission is investigating potential religious discrimination at EPIC City, which would violate the Texas Fair Housing Act. Abbott has accused the development, without providing any evidence, of creating a \"no-go zone\" that bans non-Muslims from entering.   Qadhi said the proposed EPIC City will not be exclusive to Muslim residents.   \"It's an open community,\" Qadhi said. \"Anybody can come in. We're welcoming people of all backgrounds and diversity and we're offering them facilities that we think would be very, very useful.\"   Abbott has also launched a criminal investigation of the project, although it's unclear what criminal statutes EPIC or the project developers may have violated.   Paxton has also not specified what consumer protection laws EPIC City may have violated, but he said in a press release the project has \"raised a number of concerns.\"   \n   Neither Abbott nor Paxton responded to NPR's requests for comment on the investigations.   Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the Department of Justice launched a federal probe in early May after he shared concerns about religious discrimination and Sharia law, which forms parts of Islamic traditions but is not legally enforceable in the United States.   \"Religious discrimination, whether explicit or implicit, is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\" Cornyn wrote in his letter to the attorney general. \"Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our nation's values, and I am concerned this community potentially undermines this vital protection.\"   Misconceptions about Sharia law and Islamophobia are at the center of many of the allegations being about EPIC City online and at a recent county government meeting.   Mustafaa Carroll, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth office for the Council of American Islamic Relations, said Sharia law is often misunderstood in the country.   \"Your daughters are gonna wear burqas and your sons will be terrorists and they're gonna be killing people and people will be blowing folks up and all this kind of craziness,\" Carroll said. \"That's definitely not Sharia.\"   Muslim scholars emphasize that Sharia law is deeply dependent on context. While conservative countries may enforce strict practices, Muslims in Western countries often do not.    According to EPIC, Sharia encompasses aspects of Islamic traditions like when to pray, how to dress and what to eat.   The governor's office criticized the Council of American Islamic Relations in a statement and accused the interfaith group of being linked to terrorism. The group denies those claims.   Abbott recently said in a post on X that Texas halted construction at EPIC City after he ordered the project developer last month to cease construction or face legal action because the mosque hadn't acquired the necessary permits or authorizations from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.   \n   \"The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found that the group behind the proposed EPIC compound did not submit the required permits to begin construction,\" he said.   But Dan Cogdell, an attorney for the mosque, noted that no construction had begun at the site. He said Abbott's order and the state's investigations are premature.   \"We haven't started construction,\" he said. \"We haven't even filed for an application. It's like, good God, have a cup of coffee before you pop off.\"   Online misinformation   At a county government meeting early in March, Collin County officials heard concerns from residents about the potential practice of Sharia law in EPIC City.   \"They will do the most Sharia compliance, including honor killings, stonings, marrying their young girls off to older men,\" said Krista Schild, a resident of Hunt County.   \"Sharia has no freedom of religion, no freedom of speech, no freedom of thought, no freedom of artistic expression, and no equal rights for women,\" said Lee Breckenridge-Moore, a resident of Collin County.   Schild and Moore offered no proof to support their statements.     Moore referenced as evidence for her claims social media posts from Amy Mek, the founder and editor in chief of RAIR Foundation USA. The Southern Poverty Law Center has categorized RAIR as an anti-Muslim hate group.   One of Mek's posts that accused city and school district officials in Plano of colluding with EPIC to shape school policy received about 8,900 likes and 7,800 shares. A few days later, Paxton announced in a press release he was demanding documents from the Plano Independent School District outlining \"potential connections\" to EPIC.   Public vitriol   EPIC member Fawzia Bilal said the attacks on her mosque and faith are disheartening.   \"If I'm going out alone, then there is this fear,\" Bilal said. \"Am I going to hear something? Am I going to be targeted?\"   \n   Bilal said most people in Plano are accepting because the mosque has a strong presence and is known for its service and contributions to the community.   She hopes that message will come through.   \"No matter how loud the voices of hatred are, the voice of hope and the voice of understanding and reasoning will eventually overpower these negative voices,\" she said.   In the meantime, Cogdell said EPIC will cooperate fully with all state and federal investigations. He also said he expects the political scrutiny to delay the project, leaving the Muslim community in North Texas with less room to grow.\n"

And when I felt my stomach growl while strolling the bustling streets the next day, the last thing I thought I'd see was a free snack cart.It was my first time in the Washington city, one I've wanted to visit since I was a kid. As I developed a taste for travel in college, I found myself taking road trips from California up the coast to Portland, Oregon, to see more of the Pacific Northwest.Still, Seattle was always too far north to include in my itinerary. In fact, I'd never had a chance to visit the state of Washington — until recently.During a weeklong trip from my home in New York City to the West Coast of North America in May, I spent three days in Seattle. As a first-time visitor, I found the city to be full of surprises.\n            \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I traveled to Seattle from Vancouver, and I was surprised to find that a train ticket was less than half the price of airfare.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  The author took an Amtrak train to Seattle.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          I've spent about 100 hours on Amtrak trains from the Northeast to the Southwest. In my experience, traveling by train in the US is typically more expensive than flying, though it depends on the route.So when I was booking my travel from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Seattle, I was shocked that a coach train ticket cost $50 compared with the $150 basic economy airfare on the same day.I certainly paid more in hours — the train ride took four compared with the roughly one-hour flight. Still, I was excited to travel slowly and watch landscapes transform from one country to another.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I was also shocked at how much more comfortable it was to travel in economy compared with planes.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  The author's coach seat on the train.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          I'd traveled in first and business class on Amtrak trains before, but this was my first trip in coach since I was a kid. So I wasn't sure how it would compare to my countless experiences flying in basic economy.Since the ticket was less than half the price, I didn't expect the train seat to be so much cozier than the stiff, flimsy plane seats I'm used to. I even avoided the neck and back pain I usually get when flying.On the train, the seats felt wider with more legroom than on a typical economy flight.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          Walking a mile in Seattle feels more strenuous than it does in New York.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  A hilly street in Seattle.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          I stepped off the Amtrak train in Seattle at about noon.

With an indie-rock soundtrack in my earbuds and the sun shining above me, I was excited to lug my suitcase on foot to my hotel 1 mile away.But I quickly learned that a mile in Seattle doesn't feel like a mile in New York. The route was almost entirely uphill. When I stopped to catch my breath at an intersection, I noticed the street to my right climbed up even taller for as far as I could see.In my city, I walk a lot, but most of the roads are relatively flat. So I wasn't expecting to feel so exhausted after just one mile.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I was excited to visit the iconic Pike Place Market but surprised to learn it hasn't always been a car-free space.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  Pike Place Market.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          Situated next to the coast in Downtown Seattle, Pike Place Market is an iconic outdoor market with more than 200 stores and restaurants. I've been hearing about it for decades, so I spent my first afternoon in Seattle perusing the 9-acre shopping hub.On a sunny Thursday afternoon, the market was crowded with locals and tourists alike. I shuffled my way through what felt like a line to get a peek at the fresh seafood. When I needed a break from the mob, I found refuge inside a used bookstore.Every so often, a delivery truck would drive through, dividing the crowd into two tightly packed globs, but most cars weren't allowed to drive through Pike Place Market. This made sense to me, since each passing vehicle halted the pedestrian flow.But I was surprised to learn that the open-air market's cobblestone streets are normally open to all cars — the city is testing a ban on cars aside from vendors, delivery drivers, and those with disabilities, The Seattle Times reported in April. The temporary ban began on April 23 and is set to continue until the end of summer.I was lucky enough to inadvertently schedule my trip during the ban. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if cars could freely move through the already crowded market.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I stumbled upon the popular tourist attraction, The Gum Wall, in Seattle.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  Seattle's Gum Wall.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          While wandering the narrow alleyways around Pike Place Market, I was slowed down by groups of tourists stopping to take selfies in front of a vibrant brick wall.

But when I saw a pedestrian pull a gooey wad out of their mouth and stick it on the brick wall, I realized the wall was a gum canvas.I was shocked and a little grossed out upon my realization, but when I focused on how the wall actually looked rather than the germ-infested materials, I thought it was a playful work of art.Before you ask, no, I didn't add my own contribution to the Seattle gum wall.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I was surprised to find a three-story target downtown.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  A Target in downtown Seattle.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          I lost my charging port somewhere between Vancouver and Seattle, so I headed to a Target near my downtown hotel.

The company's presence in more than 30 office buildings led to the neighborhood's nickname, \"Amazonia.\"Before visiting, I expected to find nothing but business-centric streets lined with glass skyscrapers in a tech-fueled neighborhood. So I was surprised by the large presence of nature in South Lake Union.The neighborhood borders Lake Union, where I explored a waterfront park filled with runners, bicyclists, picnickers, and geese. Locals said the park is dead on the weekends, but tech workers frequent it during the week. Nearby, the Google building had a whole forest of trees on the rooftop.\n                              \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                          I'd never seen a free banana stand before.\n                      \n                            \n                            \n                                  \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                              \n                              \n                                \n                                  A pedestrian grabbing a banana from the complimentary stand.\n                                  \n                                    \n                                      Joey Hadden/Business Insider\n                                        \n                                \n                              \n                          The pop of color caught my eye while strolling through \"Amazonia.\" In an outdoor space between Amazon buildings in South Lake Union, the bright yellow trailer is hard to miss.I got a closer look and saw boxes full of bananas beneath the awning, and a sign that read, \"Take one — not just for Amazonians but for anyone in the community.\"I didn't expect to find a free snack stand in the middle of a city.

Benamar est à la fois réalisateur et scénariste mais c’est aussi un acteur que l’on retrouve de plus en plus souvent au casting de comédie, comme la récente série Ghosts. Fantômes en héritage (sur Dysney +), où il partage la vedette avec Camille Chamoux.Quel est le premier disque que vous avez acheté adolescent avec votre propre argent ?Adolescent, ça doit être un disque de hip-hop 90’s je dirais peut-être l’album de Das EFX Dead Serious. C’était à l’époque un nouveau style de rap. Je l’écoute encore de temps en temps il défonce toujours autant !Votre moyen préféré pour écouter de la musique ?J’ai des vinyles et une platine disque Sharp à retour automatique d’époque, mais maintenant c’est sur l’ordi ou le téléphone.Le dernier disque que vous avez acheté et sous quel format ?Je ne suis plus trop album, j’écoute via des applis de streaming des singles de groupes coréens. Je regarde les charts coréens chaque semaine et je sélectionne les sons que je kiffe.Où préférez-vous écouter de la musique ?Quand je marche ou quand je fais du sport car ça me permet de réfléchir et de trouver des idées pour mes scénarios.Est-ce que vous écoutez de la musique en travaillant ?Etonnamment non, j’aime bien me concentrer, en revanche quand je sèche sur des idées, petite pause avec de la K-pop.La chanson que vous avez honte d’écouter avec plaisir ?J’ai un peu honte mais j’adore Gfriend, un groupe féminin de K-pop qui s’est séparé depuis. C’est très fleur bleue mais j‘adore !Le disque que tout le monde aime et que vous détestez ?Un album de Sade que mes cousins écoutaient en boucle à l’époque et que je détestais de fou !Le disque qu’il vous faudra pour survivre sur une île déserte ?Ce n’est pas un album mais un morceau : Last Dance de Donna Summer. Il ne vieillit pas. Le disco, c’est le genre de musique qui rend heureux quand on l’écoute.Y a-t-il un label ou une maison de disques à laquelle vous êtes particulièrement attaché et pourquoi ?La Motown, c’est tout ma jeunesse ! Pour moi, c’est le haut de gamme. Tu passes de Marvin Gaye à Diana Ross ou The Temptations, jusqu’à Michael Jackson !Quelle pochette de disque avez-vous envie d’encadrer chez vous comme une œuvre d’art ?Il y a en a plein comme Uprising de Bob Marley ou Thriller de Michael Jackson, mais celui qui nous a marqué à l’époque avec mes potes, c’était le verso de la pochette de l’album Power d’Ice-T, mais il n’y a pas que nous puisque Kendrick Lamar y a fait aussi référence.Un disque que vous aimeriez entendre à vos funérailles ?Dur de penser à ça mais je dirais Last Dance de Donna Summer.Savez-vous ce que c’est que le drone metal ?Pas du tout, attend je vais regarder… Waouh ! C’est flippant comme truc ! Je n’arrive pas à savoir quel est le but.Votre plus beau souvenir de concert ?Je dirais Al Green à Paris en 2010. Je crois que c’est Ramzy qui m’avait invité, c’était magique tous les sons était bons !Allez-vous en club pour danser, draguer, écouter de la musique sur un bon sound system ou n’allez-vous jamais en club ?Avant oui, on ne va pas se mentir, c’était pour pécho ! Maintenant je vais moins en club… je suis marié.Quel est le groupe que vous détestez voir sur scène, mais dont vous adorez les disques et inversement ?Houla, je passe cette question car je vais rarement en concert.Votre film musical préféré ou votre musique de film préférée ?Il y en a plein mais je dirais Fame de 1980, la BO est folle !Quel est le disque que vous partagez avec la personne qui vous accompagne dans la vie ?J’écoute de la K-pop, ma femme est moins fan mais mes enfants kiffent, donc dans la bagnole c’est K-pop time.Le morceau qui vous rend fou de rage ?Fou de rage ? Non, faut être débile pour écouter un morceau qui t’énerve. Je ne comprends pas le concept.Le dernier disque que vous avez écouté en boucle ?Je dirais la BO de Encanto de chez Disney, car dans la bagnole ce sont les enfants qui décident. Mais sinon, en ce moment, j’écoute des chanteuses vietnamiennes comme Pháo ou Suboi, c’est génial, je conseille à fond !Le groupe dont vous auriez aimé faire partie ?J’hésite entre un boys band ou Public Enemy, je ne sais pas pourquoi.La chanson ou le morceau de musique qui vous fait toujours pleurer ?Je ne pleure pas trop sinon je n‘écoute pas, mais j’adore le Nobody Rainstone Remix des Wonder Girls. Je l’ai même mis dans un épisode de la série Week-end Family que j’ai réalisé, sur Disney +.Quels sont vos titres fétiches ?Donna Summer, Last Dance (1978). Wonder Girls, Nobody (2008).

    "description": "K-pop, which has been unofficially banned in China for almost a decade, may be on the verge of being allowed back in.",
    "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/k-pop-banned-china-almost-decade-now-maybe-rcna209901",
    "full_text": "HONG KONG — The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang “heartbroken.”“The venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,” she said.C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited “local circumstances” in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.Before the ban, China — the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan — was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.“In the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China’s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,” said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.But the Epex concert’s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers’ Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would “proceed without issue.”There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China’s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.“It shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,” said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. “It might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.”The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.China’s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop’s high-spending fans.EPEX performs on the music program \"Show Champion\" in Goyang, South Korea, on April 17, 2024.MBCPLUS / ImaZins via Getty ImagesChina has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film “Ne Zha 2,” the world’s highest-grossing animated film ever.“It now has robust resilience against the ‘invasion’ of foreign content,” she said.China’s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump’s tariffs.China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week’s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.“If he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,” Kim said.Eve QiaoEve Qiao is an intern on NBC News's Asia Desk.Julia ZhongJulia Zhong is an intern on NBC News's Asia Desk.Stella Kim contributed."

BANGKOK, THAILAND - FEBRUARY 14: Lalisa Manobal attends \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 Bangkok Premiere at ICONSIAM River Park on February 14, 2025 in Bangkok, Thailand. (Photo by Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images for HBO)Getty Images for HBO\nIn just a few weeks, “Priceless” has become not only a hit for Lisa, but one of her most successful U.S. radio releases to date. The tune, fronted by pop band Maroon 5 and featuring the Thai rapper and Blackpink member, continues to climb several of Billboard’s airplay rankings. After a short time on the charts, the single hits a new, never-before-seen peak for her.\n\n\n“Priceless” Becomes Lisa’s Biggest Radio Hit\n“Priceless” rises from No. 22 to No. 19 on the latest edition of the Pop Airplay chart. That roster ranks the most successful tunes on top 40 pop radio stations across the U.S., and it’s where Lisa now earns a brand new career-best.\n\n\nLast week, “Priceless” sat in second place among Lisa’s five appearances on the Pop Airplay chart. It landed just one spot behind the No. 21 peak of “Moonlit Floor,” a position that track reached in February. Now, as it jumps three spots, the Maroon 5 collaboration allows Lisa to enter the top 20 for the first time.\n\nLisa Follows Blackpink Bandmates Jennie and Rosé\n“Priceless” is now the third-highest-rising hit in Pop Airplay chart history by a solo female K-pop musician. It’s just one spot shy of matching the No. 18 peak of “One of the Girls,” which credits fellow Blackpink singer Jennie, as well as both The Weeknd, and Lily-Rose Depp.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe all-time best showing by any female soloist from the K-pop scene on this ranking belongs to Rosé. Her team-up with Bruno Mars, “Apt.,” is, so far, the only cut to ever hit No. 1 that credits a K-pop musical act of any kind.\n\nJust last week, “Priceless” ranked as the fourth-highest-rising win that fits this description, sitting between Lisa’s own “Moonlit Floor” and “Toxic Till the End” by Rosé, which was stationed at No. 23. That ranking has changed, and “Priceless” could very well continue its forward surge in the coming weeks, and perhaps even months.\n\n\nLisa and Maroon 5 Hit the Radio Songs Chart\nLisa and Maroon 5 are currently climbing all three of Billboard’s pop radio lists. The collaboration may break into the top 10 on the Adult Pop Airplay chart next week, as it now sits at a new high of No. 11. The track, which has spent just two frames on the Adult Contemporary list, is up to No. 28. At the same time, the song debuts at No. 45 on the all-genre Radio Songs roster, marking Lisa’s first career appearance on that ranking.\n"

Искусство решения мини задач на пределе своих возможностей оттачивает наше умение для реальных задач.   Дональд Кнут (с)Как известно, на машине Тьюринга (далее МТ) запрограммировать можно всё, что мы вообще считаем программируемым, но в реальности программы на МТ настолько громоздкие, что МТ редко используется даже в академических примерах. И тем не менее в некоторых отдельных случаях с помощью МТ получается написать небольшую программу, на КДПВ изображена программа из 5 состояний на алфавите из 3 символом. Если вы изучали программирование, то задачу, которую решает эта программа, вы скорее всего встречали. Если я сумел вас заинтересовать, то приглашаю в небольшое приключение по реверс инженирингу МТ.Материал статьи предоставлен Владимиром ПинаевымНапоминалка про МТСуществует множество незначительно отличающихся друг от друга вариантов МТ, опишу используемый в этом эмуляторе, в котором можно будет и проверитьАлфавит  и специальный «пустой» символ λ.Конечное множество состояний , начальное состояние .Правила перехода . В соответствии с этими правилами паре (состояние, символ) сопоставляется тройка (новое состояние, символ, направление сдвига).Такая программа применяется к бесконечной в обе стороны ленте, состоящей из ячеек с символамиЛента МТ состоит из ячеек, в каждой из которых записан какой-то символ. В процессе работы программа на МТ двигается по ленте и меняет символы на ней.Работа программы заключается в последовательном применении правил перехода к текущему состоянию и символу на текущей позиции ленты. Если текущие состояние системы — , символ на текущий позиции — , а таблица выдаёт переход , то это означает, что на текущем шаге происходит следующее:Символ  в текущей позиции заменяется на символ .Двигаемся влево если , вправо, если , или завершаем программу, если .Меняем состояние на .Программа на повесткеИтак, мы хотим понять, что делает следующая программа:Алфавит состоит из трёх символов A, B, C + пустой.Всего пять состояний q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.Таблица переходов выглядит такQ\\EABCλq0B R q2C R q3A R q1q1A R q1C L q4B L q4!q2C L q4B R q2A L q4!q3B L q4A L q4C R q3!q4A L q4B L q4C L q4λ R q0Один переход не указан: по задумке таких переходов происходить не должно. Эту программу предполагается применять к последовательности одинаковых символов. Можете проверить, такая программа делает из одной последовательности одинаковых символов другую последовательность. Вроде бы ничего интересного, можно было бы обойтись и одним состоянием, но давайте не торопиться с выводами.Попробуем проанализировать …Давайте посмотрим, что происходит в каждом из состояний:q0 всегда делает замену символа (A→B, B→C, C→A) и переводит программу в одно из состояний q1, q2, q3.q1, q2, q3 устроены схожим образом: q1 едет вправо по символу А, а на B или С останавливается меняя один на другой и переводя программу в состояний q4. q2, q3 действуют по аналогии с q1, но с буквами.q4 едет в начало ленты и переводит систему в состояний q0.Программа останавливается, если q1, q2 или q3 доехали до конца ленты по своему символу, т. е. в случае если все символы одинаковы после замены в состоянии q0.Итого программу можно представить в виде цикла, каждая итерация которого делает что-то такое:Меняем первый символ на ленте: A становится B, B становится С, а С становится А.Ищем самый левый символ отличный от того, что мы только что записали в первой позиции и меняем его на оставшийся символ, т.е. если в первую позицию мы записали В, то дальше мы ищем первую А или С и меняем А на С или С на А.Так, давайте ка напишем это на языке попроще и посмотрим, что происходитdef misterious_ABC_sequence(length: int):\n    sequence = ['A' for _ in range(length)]\n    first_symbol_map = {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'A'}\n\n    changes = []\n    states = []\n\n    while True:\n        new_symbol = first_symbol_map[sequence[0]]\n        changes.append(f\"{0}: {sequence[0]} -> {new_symbol}\")\n        sequence[0] = new_symbol\n        states.append([x for x in sequence])\n\n        was_changed = False;\n        for i in range(1, length):\n            if sequence[i] != sequence[0]:\n                new_symbol = ({'A', 'B', 'C'} - {sequence[0], sequence[i]}).pop() \n                changes.append(f\"{i}: {sequence[i]} -> {new_symbol}\")\n                sequence[i] = new_symbol\n                states.append([x for x in sequence])\n                was_changed = True\n                break\n\n        if not was_changed:\n            return changes, statesДавайте попробуем позапускать. Первое, что можно обнаружить — это то, что длина states — это степ , где  — длина последовательности. Хммм, давайте посмотрим чуть внимательней на changes при запуске с length=5.0: A -> B\n1: A -> C\n0: B -> C\n2: A -> B\n0: C -> A\n1: C -> B\n0: A -> B\n3: A -> C\n0: B -> C\n1: B -> A\n0: C -> A\n2: B -> C\n0: A -> B\n1: A -> C\n0: B -> C\n4: A -> B\n0: C -> A\n1: C -> B\n0: A -> B\n2: C -> A\n0: B -> C\n1: B -> A\n0: C -> A\n3: C -> B\n0: A -> B\n1: A -> C\n0: B -> C\n2: A -> B\n0: C -> A\n1: C -> B\n0: A -> BNota bene! spoilers ahead. Если вы хотите сами подумать над задачей, то стоит на этом месте остановится, очень скоро будут спойлеры!Так, что еще можно вынести, ну например можно обратить внимание, что 0-ая ячейка меняется на каждом втором шаге, 1-ая на каждом 4-ом шаге, 2-ая на каждом 8-ом и так далее. Хмм, может это как-то связано с двоичной системой счисления? Непонятно, вроде бы состояний ленты , так как на каждой из k позиций может быть написан один из трех символов. Давайте посмотрим, что происходит на ленте на итерациях, соответствующих степеням двойки0 ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n1 ['B', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n3 ['C', 'C', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n7 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A']\n15 ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'A']\n31 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']Ага, значит за  шагов мы меняем первые  символов на B или C (если начинали с последовательности из символов А).Раскрываем картыЛадно, если вы еще не догадались, то это программа решаетЗадачу …о Ханойских башняхСуть задачи заключается в следующем: у вас есть  дисков разного диаметра с дырками посередине и три вертикальных стержня, на которые эти диски можно расположить. Изначально диски расположены на одном из стержней в порядке уменьшения диаметра, за один ход разрешается переместить верхний диск на другой стержень, если там уже не лежит   диск меньшего диаметра. Нужно перенести все диски с одного стержня на другой. Дополнительный вопрос — какое минимальное количество ходов для этого нужно.Традиционно это задача является хорошим примером рекурсивных функций и соответствующего индуктивного мышления: давайте представим, что мы научились перекладывать башню размером  c одного стержня на другой, тогда, чтобы переложить башню размером , можно сначала перенести верхние  дисков на другой стержень, переложить самый нижний диск и снова перенести верхние  дисков поверх переложенного нижнего стержня.image.pngЕсли обозначить за  количество действий в таком алгоритме, то получается, что Очевидно, что , и соответственно это рекуррентное соотношение приводит к явной формулеЛегко увидеть, что это также является и оптимальным алгоритмом с точки зрения количества ходов: в какой-то момент нам так или иначе придётся переложить самый нижний диск, а это возможно сделать только если все остальные диски сложены на одном из стержней. А вот и соответствующая рекурсивная программа:def hanoi_towers_recursive(length: int, source: int, target: int):\n    if length == 1:\n        return [(0, source, target)]\n    intermediate = 3 - source - target\n    return [*hanoi_towers_recursive(length - 1, source, intermediate),\n            (length - 1, source, target),\n            *hanoi_towers_recursive(length - 1, intermediate, target)]И вывод следующего кода идентичен листингу выше для длины 5towers = ['A', 'B', 'C']\n\nfor i, (disk, source, target) in enumerate(hanoi_towers_recursive(5, 0, 1)):\n    print(f\"{i + 1} {disk}: {towers[source]} -> {towers[target]}\")Рекурсия в этом случае выступает мощным инструментом, благодаря которому довольно сложную на первый взгляд задачу получается решить очень простым и понятным методом.Почему рекурсия и МТ выдают одинаковый результат?Программа МТ для решения ханойской башни выстроена не из соображений рекурсии, а как обычный итеративный алгоритм, который имитирует поведение рекурсивного алгоритма. Чтобы понять почему они делают одно и тоже давайте немного посмотрим на сам алгоритм и на пару его свойств. Начнем с ленточного представления состояния дисков на стержнях. В МТ мы считаем диски пронумерованными, на ленте зарезервировано k ячеек для каждого из дисков, символ означает на каком из стержней A, В или С расположен конкретный диск. Так как на каждом стержне диски располагаются в порядке убывания диаметра, то расположение дисков однозначно задаётся стержнем. Дальше заметим следующееНаблюдение №1. В любой момент времени можно либо переместить самый маленький диск двумя способами, либо какой-то другой одним способом кроме случая когда все диски на одном стержне.Здесь все довольно просто. Самый маленький диск обязан быть на самом верху и его можно перенести на любой из соседних стержней. Если же не все стержни находятся на одном, то возможен еще один ход: меньший из дисков (кроме самого маленького) можно перенести на стержень, где не расположен самый маленький диск.Наблюдение №2. Каждый нечетный ход оптимального алгоритма делается самым маленьким диском.Это можно видеть и из структуры рекурсивного алгоритма, но можно и заключить из предыдущего наблюдения: если мы попытаемся два раза подряд сделать ход не наименьшим диском, то получится только вернуться к предыдущему состоянию. Отсюда получается, что в оптимальном алгоритме ходы меньшего диска и всех остальных должны чередоватьсяНаблюдение №3. Маленький диск перемещается либо по направлению A→B→C→A, либо A→C→B→A на протяжении всего алгоритма.Вот это уже менее очевидное свойство, его легко увидеть, но сложнее доказать почему так происходит. Если быть точнее, то происходит вот чтоЛемма. Оптимальный алгоритм, перемещающий башню длины k со стержня А на стержень В делаетПервый и последний ход A→B самым маленьким диском при нечетных kДелает первый ход А→C и последний C→B самым маленьким диском для четных kЛемма доказывается по индукции. Алгоритм должен сначала перенести верхние  дисков A→C, перенести нижний диск на В и перенести  дисков C→B. Если  нечетно, а значит первый ход делается A→C (первый ход переноса A→C), а последний C→B (последний ход переноса С→B). Для четного же  первый и последний ходы становятся A→В.Из леммы легко обосновывается Наблюдение №3: опять же воспользуемся индукцией для четных k получаем, что первый перенос  верхних дисков проходил в направлении A→С→В→A, последним ходом был А→С, следующим ходом после перемещения нижнего диска будет С→B и дальше движение в том же направлении. Для нечетного k последний ход переноса верхних  дисков заканчивается на A→B, а второй перенос начинается с В→C и движение происходит в направлении A→B→C→A.Так, мы разобрались с тем, что состояние q0 в МТ программе отвечает за перегон наименьшего диска по кругу и это соответствует поведению оптимального алгоритма. Наконец из наблюдения №1 заключаем, что ход не самым маленьким диском единственен: если на предыдущем шаге мы переместили самый маленький диск на стержень X, то следующим ходом мы обязаны перенести наименьший диск, не лежащий на Х, на оставшийся стержень. Эта логика в точности описана в состояниях q1, q2, q3 и её аналогу misterious_ABC_sequence.Хмм, а можно ли еще уменьшить программу?Как оказывается можно, но есть нюанс: возможно сделать программу на МТ в 4 состояния, которая решает задачу о хайноских башнях, но не за минимальное возможное число перекладываний.  Спросим себя, на чем мы можем сэкономить. В варианте с пятью состояниями преобразование первого символа происходит по кругу «A → B → C → A → B → C …». А что если исключить в этой последовательности вовсе символ «C»? В интерпретации Ханойской башни это означало бы, что первый диск никогда не побывает на стержне «C»! Будет ли это препятствием для решения классической Ханойской башни? Нет! Предлагаю читателям самостоятельно доказать это несложное утверждение.Однако, вернемся к нашей МТ. Ранее после выполнения хода первым диском мы запоминали посредством состояния, куда был перемещен первый диск: Если первый диск переместился со стержня «A» на стержень «B», то МТ переходила в состояние q2; Если первый диск переместился со стержня «B» на стержень «C», то МТ переходила в состояние q3; Если первый диск переместился со стержня «C» на стержень «A», то МТ переходила в состояние q1. Теперь, когда первому диску запрещено перемещаться на стержень «C», надобность в состоянии q3 исчезает! Как и ранее, ход не первым диском возможен всегда единственным образом. Поэтому после выполнения хода первым диском, мы спускаемся по списку дисков, пропуская символы, совпадающие с нынешним расположением первого диска. Далее возможны два варианта: либо мы выходим на пустую ячейку ленты (и тогда достигнуто заключительное состояние), либо находим иной символ и делаем единственно возможный ход. В итоге получается следующая МТ с четырьмя состояниями.Q\\EABCλq0B R q2A R qq1A R q1C L q3B L q3!q2C L q3B R q2A L q3!q3A L q3B L q3C L q3λ R q0Эта МТ успешно справляется с поставленной задачей и, моделируя ходы Ханойской башни, преобразует строку из символов «A» независимо от четности всегда в строку из символов «B». Правда, расплатой за меньшее число состояний будет большее число ходов.Быть может что-то еще?Казалось бы, можно остановиться, но мы поразмышляем над задачей еще: что если изначально диски размещены не на одном стержни, а как-то произвольно? Окончанием игры будет служить башня, собранная по стандартным правилам на одном из стержней. В такой постановке задача всегда имеет решение. Заметим, что фраза «произвольное начальное размещение дисков» имеет два принципиально различных толкования: либо диски изначально размещены по стержням произвольным образом без нарушения правила «диск большего диаметра не может лежать на диске меньшего диаметра», либо при выборе начальной конфигурации упомянутое выше правило не проверяется. При любом толковании задача всегда имеет решение. Далее мы остановимся на первом толковании перемешанной Ханойской башни по той причине, что выбранный способ представления данных на ленте МТ, когда дискам, начиная с первого, соответствуют символы стержней, не позволяет реализовать второе толкование. И вот сейчас «изюминка на торте» – при незначительной переделке МТ с четырьмя состояниями оказывается способной решать перемешанную Ханойскую башню! Изменения управляющей таблицы связаны с возможным начальным размещением первого диска на стержне «C». Ниже приводится окончательный вариант МТ с четырьмя состояниями.Q\\EABCλq0B R q2A R qB R q2q1A R q1C L q3B L q3!q2C L q3B R q2A L q3!q3A L q3B L q3C L q3λ R q0СсылкиБасов И Решение задачи о ханойских башнях на машине ТьюрингаПинаев В.

Curiosamente, en España, la canción, más conocida como “apeché” en los patios de los colegios, se ha hecho especialmente popular entre los niños y niñas más pequeños. Estos, claro está, no saben qué dice la letra. Y menos mal, porque todo va de un popular juego coreano de beber. De beber alcohol, por si quedaban dudas.\n\nLa canción, explicó la propia Rosé en una entrevista en Vogue, está inspirada en un juego coreano conocido como apateu (en coreano: 아파트). Aunque su traducción literal es “apartamento”, es el nombre de su más conocido juego de beber, en la línea de nuestro quinito o el estadounidense beer pong.\n \n  \n   \n  \n \nCómo jugar al ‘apartamento’\n\nEl juego en sí no tiene ningún misterio, pero es muy popular en Corea para romper el hielo en las fiestas. Los participantes apilan sus manos en el centro de una mesa y una persona menciona un número. La mano que está en la parte inferior debe colocarse arriba hasta alcanzar ese número. Quien quede último en mover su mano debe beber.\n  @drinkmakku All you need for this one is some good friends and some good Sool (we suggest Màkku) 🥳 #fypシ #drinkinggame #koreandrinks #asiantiktok #asianbusiness ♬ original sound - drinkmakku   La letra de la canción, puro pop sin demasiadas pretensiones líricas, juega con el doble sentido de la palabra, pero deja caer algunas referencias al juego para los iniciados:\n\nTurn this 아파트into a club (uh-huh, uh-huh) \n\nI'm talking drink, dance, smoke, freak, party all night (come on)\n\nEl juego, de hecho, aparece fugazmente en el videoclip de la canción, cuando Bruno Mars y Rosé están sentados uno al frente del otros, con las manos entrelazadas, y acaban tomándose un chupito.\n \n\n“Es un juego muy simple que siempre rompe el hielo en las fiestas”, declaró la cantante. \"Recuerdo que volví a casa [del estudio] un poco asustada. ¿Está bien, que haya escrito una canción sobre un juego de beber?”\n\nCon lo que no contaba seguro es con que haya millones de infantes en toda España cantando su canción sin tener ni la más remota idea de lo que esconde detrás. \n\nEn DAP | Por qué la estrella del Kpop J-Hope, de los BTS, se hace fotos con unas patatas fritas gallegas\n\nEn DAP | Este plato típico callejero aparece en casi todas las series coreanas y hay que probarlo si o si\n\n \n "

    "description": "A love letter to a small noise in a big Star Wars show.",
    "url": "https://gizmodo.com/andor-cassian-bryar-pistol-sound-star-wars-2000601838",
    "full_text": "\n              \n              \n              There is a lot to love in Andor. It is a dense show, a big show, one that is filled with fascinatingly layered characters worth diving deep into, twisting plotlines that hold a mirror up to our world and the galaxy far, far away alike. It’s a show that, in spite of a certain reputation in contrast to other Star Wars stories, is filled with little nods to the franchise’s history old and new. But right now, at least in our moment of interest, it’s a show where Cassian Andor’s blaster pistol goes vuh-weeeeee. Just like Andor more broadly, there’s also a lot to love about Cassian’s blaster pistol. It’s a MW-20 Bryar pistol, itself one of those aforementioned little nods: the design is heavily inspired by the legendary K-16 Bryar pistol wielded by Kyle Katarn in the Star Wars video game series Dark Forces, a character with intriguing parallels to Cassian even beyond the latter in part subsuming the role of the former in modern continuity.\n\n It’s a good-looking gun design even beyond that legacy, just a flat wedge of weaponry with a handle attached—different enough to Han’s iconic DL-44 but in that sort of vein, that excellent Star Wars mix of looking just askance to a real-world gun but with a greebled, sci-fi layer. It also does a little flippy-thing with the body of the blaster that’s very cool, which brings us to that sound. The vuh-weeeeee is what accompanies that spinning of main section of the blaster, and in a franchise just bursting with incredible sound design, it’s maybe one of Andor‘s best additions to the auditory canon. It’s subtle, but pointed, a layer of Cassian’s intimidation whenever he pulls the pistol out to point at someone. Star Wars guns don’t need cocking or reloading like some actual weapons do; a blaster bolt is superheated gas condensed into a shard of pure energy. Maybe that’s the gas being primed, maybe the chamber is re-filling the flow of tibanna ready to be charged up and fired. Honestly I don’t really care to know, because while the internal mechanics of a MW-20 Bryar blaster pistol might be cool, but they’re kind of not the point. © Lucasfilm The vuh-weeeeee serves as a similar auditory clue to both the audience and the characters around Cassian that he’s ready to pop off at a moment’s notice. There’s an actual mechanical ka-chunk noise too, presumably of that spinning section locking back into place on the blaster, but it’s the vuh-weeeeee that really sticks in your ear, this high-pitched little whine. In Andor Cassian is the kind of man who rarely pulls out a blaster pistol to not use it: from Skeen to Cloris, when the bryar’s broken out, he means business. You hear that ka-chunk, as it settles into a vuh-weeeeee, and you know Cassian’s good to go, and that somebody’s probably about to get a bolt put through them.\n\n This high strung, intense little noise is not unlike the wielder of the weapon that makes it. After all, what is Cassian Andor if not a primed bolt of pure energy, ready to go off at a moment’s notice, ready to be aimed in the direction of something and fired at it for maximum effect? All it takes is a ka-chunk, then a vuh-weeeeee, and he’s ready to burn a hole through the structures of power he’s rebelling against. Perhaps all that’s true. But maybe it’s also just true that vuh-weeeeee sounds cool as hell, and in a show already bursting with so many ideas and details, at the end of the day, you also just need a bunch of cool spacey noises. Andor is all that character work, all that symbolism and commentary, but it’s also the vuh-weeeeee. And it wouldn’t quite be Star Wars if it wasn’t both.  Want more io9 news?

    "title": "10 Underrated ATEEZ Songs That Every K-Pop Fan Should Appreciate",
    "description": "ATEEZ is known for their powerful sound and stage presence, but some of their music continues to be criminally underrated, even in the K-Pop realm.",
    "url": "https://screenrant.com/ateez-underrated-songs/",
    "full_text": "ATEEZ is an eight-member K-Pop boy group under KQ Entertainment that is here to stay. Their music is flashy, and their performances are impeccable, bringing a consistent level of stage presence and energy that most groups can only dream of.    Their debut mini-album from 2018 is nothing to laugh at, but it serves as an impressive jumping-off point for where their soon-to-be signature style would go shortly after. ATEEZ's chemistry as a group shines in everything they do. That, combined with their well-known ability to command every stage they step foot on, has already led them to become the first K-Pop boy group to perform at Coachella in 2024 and the first K-Pop artist to perform at Morocco's Mawazine music festival that same year.    Their music speaks for itself, but a large portion of their discography feels incredibly underrated. The songs listed below are just 10 that I feel deserve much more appreciation among ATEEZ fans and K-Pop fans in general - and among those who simply enjoy good pop music.    \n            10 \n        \n                            DEEP DIVE\n                    \n       \n            GOLDEN HOUR : Part.2 (2024)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nMany of the songs on this list were, at the time of release, overshadowed by more popular tracks. \"DEEP DIVE\" had to compete with the effortlessly cool title track \"Ice On My Teeth\" and \"Selfish Waltz,\" another synth-pop track to add to their collection that is arguably one of their best songs, so it's no wonder it got swept under the rug. With its haunting lyrics about growing accustomed to loneliness and references to actual events, particularly in the rap verses, \"DEEP DIVE\" immediately stands out to me as one of the group's most honest songs    \n                        The higher I go, the thinner the air gets    \n                    Like altitude sickness, even my companions fade away    \n                    A cold space where I face my innеr self    \n                    I’m smiling, but why does it look like I’m crying?    \n                    Likе shoddy construction, the lies I’ve built up, when will they crumble?    \n                    Hiding my anxiety, I hold my breath    \n            Rapper Mingi delivers what might be my favorite of his verses in a long time, directly calling out the anxiety that forced him to take a hiatus in 2020, while Hongjoong acknowledges his crammed schedule that included attending two fashion shows in Paris directly after the first leg of their most recent world tour. I'm a sucker for lyrics, and this song checks all the boxes.    \n            9 \n        \n                            THANXX\n                    \n       \n            ZERO : FEVER Part.1 (2020)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\"THANXX\" is the only title track on this list. While reviewing the group's catalog, there were certain title tracks that felt more widely recognized than others, but none felt more underrated than this. Like most music that was released in 2020, unfortunate timing could have something to do with its wider reception. ZERO : FEVER Part.1 is a great collection of seven tracks that couldn't have been led by a more appropriate song.            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n                \n        \n    \n        \n        \n                        \t                \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                    \n        \n    \n                \n    \n\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n        \n                    Related\n\n                \n                 \n                \t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10 Essential K-Pop Albums Every Fan Should Listen To\n\t\t\n\t\n\n                                                    \n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhether you're just getting into the genre or are a lifelong fan, these 10 essential albums are sure to deepen your love of K-Pop music.\n\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n            \n                \n        \n        \n        \n            \nThe group was just starting to find their footing, and \"THANXX\" sees them question the authority that looms over their every move. It's a song that feels almost cocky in its delivery, something that I think ATEEZ does perfectly but not nearly enough. They detest common phrases like \"Back in my day\" and \"You'll know when you get a little older\" with youthful authenticity that lets listeners know right away they're a group who do things their own way.    \n            8 \n        \n                            Celebrate\n                    \n       \n            ZERO : FEVER Part.2 (2021)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nYou'll notice from this list alone that ATEEZ is capable of sounding right at home in several different sounds. \"Celebrate\" is a B-side that accompanies the title track \"Fireworks (I'm The One),\" a steamy, powerful song whose music video alone could distract just about anyone from the rest of the mini-album that, in my opinion, houses some of their best songs.    \n\n\n\n        \n            ATEEZ is capable of sounding right at home in several different sounds.\n    \n        \n    The lyrics to \"Celebrate\" encourage anyone listening to celebrate the little things in life, including the things that make each one of us different. Every time they sing \"Congratulations for being born as you are\" in the chorus, I feel like I'm receiving the most motivational pep talk I could ever hope for. It's the type of song that's perfect to start your day with, and the music video is enough to put a smile on your face.    \n            7 \n        \n                            WE KNOW\n                    \n       \n            THE WORLD EP.FIN : WILL (2023)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\"WE KNOW\" off of their latest full-length album, THE WORLD EP.FIN : WILL, is another that couldn't help but fade to the background among a track list that includes \"Crazy Form,\" \"ARRIBA,\" and four jaw-dropping subunit tracks that include a solo ballad by Jongho that gives me goosebumps every time he opens his mouth. This track feels perfect on the album that concludes their dystopian THE WORLD trilogy.    It could easily be found on the same album as \"Guerrilla,\" filling out the unique atmosphere they've created within their albums that is worthy of its own feature film. Sirens permeate the background to make you feel like you're the one running for your life. The rap verses raise the stakes until the bridge brings everything in closer, only to burst at the seams in the final chorus.    \n            6 \n        \n                            Siren\n                    \n       \n            GOLDEN HOUR : Part.1 (2024)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nATEEZ welcomed in a new era in 2024, shortly after their performances at Coachella. \"WORK\" introduced an entirely new sound, and its B-sides did much of the same.

It has the same dystopian feeling as songs like \"Sector 1\" or \"Outlaw,\" the latter being another underrated song that almost made this list, while also welcoming in a raw power that elevates their previous releases. Mingi delivers another of my personal favorite verses of his, while the chanting chorus feels made to be performed in stadiums by their fans who have more than proved themselves capable of matching the group's energy.    \n            5 \n        \n                            AURORA\n                    \n       \n            TREASURE EP.3 : One To All (2019)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nThe group's 2019 mini-album, TREASURE EP.3 : One To All, was the one that saw them achieve their first music show win with \"Wave,\" a song that is consistently appreciated by the members and played on every tour to constant excitement from the audience. I love \"Wave\" as much as the next person... well, maybe not as much. It's a fun, summery song that is understandably a favorite, but my loyalties lie with \"AURORA.\"    \n\n\n\n        \n            ATEEZ doesn't have any other song like \"AURORA.\"\n    \n        \n    ATEEZ doesn't have any other song like \"AURORA.\" Its dreamy instrumental builds to an even dreamier chorus accompanied by beautiful falsetto from the group's vocalists. Everything from the scaled-back vocal delivery to Hongjoong and Mingi's more gentle rap verses feel unique to just this one song, making it a spectacle with every listen and every viewing of its performance video that each K-Pop fan needs to hear at least once.    \n            4 \n        \n                            TO THE BEAT\n                    \n       \n            ZERO : FEVER Part.1 (2020)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nDon't let the silly music video fool you. \"TO THE BEAT\" is one of ATEEZ's most confident songs that borders right on the line between confidence and cockiness, something I always appreciate in K-Pop from groups like BTS who know their worth and aren't afraid to let you know.    \n                        Now the excitement is going up endlessly, everything exploded (Exploded)    \n                    But why do you have a problem? Are you offended? (Sorry!)    \n                    It’s the inferiority complex, we're already on another level    \n                    No matter how much you try, we will win it all    \n            I'm just now realizing that I've somehow included my three favorite Mingi rap verses on this list, and I'm not quite sure how that happened. If I had to pick a favorite, it'd definitely be his verse in \"TO THE BEAT,\" especially when it's performed live, and you can visibly see his confidence grow as it goes on. Hongjoong's verse that starts the song drops you right into its energy, calling out those who try to copy them with unmerciful honesty. Overall, this song continues to be one of their strongest, and one I hope they emulate in a future release.    \n            3 \n        \n                            WDIG (Where Do I Go)\n                    \n       \n            THE WORLD EP.1 : MOVEMENT (2022)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\"WDIG (Where Do I Go)\" is a song that I didn't come to fully appreciate until sometime last year. It's another that was almost immediately brushed aside by both fans and ATEEZ in favor of its more well-known counterparts \"Guerrilla,\" \"Cyberpunk,\" and \"New World.\" In all fairness, it never really stood a chance, but now it's one of my three favorites from this mini-album. It's also one that I feel like the only fan in the world of, so we need to change that.    \n\n\n\n        \n            This mini-album deserves to be appreciated for all of its tracks and the atmosphere they create.\n    \n        \n    Out of the six songs from THE WORLD EP.1 : MOVEMENT, \"WDIG (Where Do I Go)\" is the only one that's never been performed live, which feels like a crime to a certain degree. Wooyoung, Jongho, and San's vocal delivery in the pre-choruses were what ultimately pulled me in. The quiet devastation in their voices juxtaposes with the song's overall gritty sound to provide a balance that never feels out of place. This mini-album deserves to be appreciated for all of its tracks and the atmosphere they create altogether.    \n            2 \n        \n                            White Love\n                    \n       \n            Season Songs (2021)\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \nATEEZ's most underrated project is Season Songs, a special mini-album of three tracks that each emulates the feeling of a different season or holiday. \"Be My Lover\" is the perfect song for spring and summer that features Kim Jong Kook. \"The Black Cat Nero\" is a K-Pop cover of an Italian children's song that was covered by Turbo, a duo featuring Kim Jong Kook, and then covered by ATEEZ with a new sound perfect for your Halloween playlist.            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n                \n        \n    \n        \n        \n                        \t                \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                    \n                    \n        \n    \n                \n    \n\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n        \n                    Related\n\n                \n                 \n                \t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t10 K-Pop Artists You Need To See On Tour In 2025\n\t\t\n\t\n\n                                                    \n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tK-Pop is all about the performances, so why not find some time this year to see your favorite K-Pop artists on tour?

In January 2023, all the singles released through this company disappeared, leaving fans in shambles until they were re-uploaded weeks later.    As soon as I watched the \"Don't Stop\" music video for the first time, it became my favorite video of theirs. The video doesn't feature any choreography, just clips of the members that connect to form their most cohesive plot yet. It's a loud song that transitions between more grating instrumentals and a piano-driven sound in the second verse. I don't think they have many songs like this, and they for sure don't have any music videos like it. If you get nothing else out of this, I hope you get to hear ATEEZ's \"Don't Stop\" for the first time.    ​​​​​​​    \n    \n    \n    \n"

(Photo by Christopher Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty Images\nK-pop’s global momentum isn’t just confined to chart-topping hits and massive album sales this year: it’s on full display under the bright lights of arenas and stadiums worldwide with new milestones hit by the likes of SEVENTEEN, Stray Kids, BTS’ j-hope, TVXQ!, BABYMONSTER and more.\n\n\nFollowing the latest reports on midyear tour figures, the K-pop industry’s touring business has surpassed previous milestones with entertainment agencies leaning more heavily on live-performance revenue as we near the second half of 2025. It marks an apparent shift in K-pop, transitioning from being dependent on album sales to concert-fueled growth, with the trend unlikely to swing back as the rest of the year promises more prominent shows on the way.\n\nSEVENTEEN Lead K-Pop’s Midyear Tour Report\nBillboard’s midyear Boxscore report revealed that SEVENTEEN firmly established themselves as a world-class live act. Based on the reported touring data from October 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025, the boy band earned a staggering $120.9 million in gross revenue with 842,000 tickets sold during the period. Before celebrating their 10th anniversary in May, the stars secured the Number 3 spot on Billboard Boxscore’s all-genre midyear list — only slightly behind Coldplay and Shakira, who are on massive stadium tours of their own with that have grossed a respective $142.1 million and $130 million. Remarkably, SEVENTEEN essentially doubled its midyear gross for the second consecutive year, jumping from $30 million in 2023 to $67.5 million in 2024.\n\n\nSEVENTEEN’s third-place finish marks the highest ranking ever achieved by a Korean act in Billboard Boxscore’s midyear tally, surpassing BTS’ previous Number 4 midyear placement from 2022.\n\nBut SEVENTEEN wasn’t the lone live phenomenon. Five K-pop acts made the all-genre Top 50 ranking for Billboard Boxscore, up from three in 2023 and two in 2022.\nFellow boy band ATEEZ, as well as j-hope of BTS, follow SEVENTEEN with $28.4 million and $28.1 million grossed, respectively, with j-hope noted as the first K-pop soloist ever to land on the midyear overall Top Tours chart. Rounding out this top five are ENHYPEN and TOMORROW X TOGETHER, grossing $25.6 million and $25.1 million, respectively.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nOverall, K-pop acts on the midyear Top Tours chart generated $228 million while selling 1.6 million tickets from 78 reported shows. Billboard reports that the scene’s 2025 showing is a 79% increase over the 2024 total, which had already jumped 93% from 2023. In just two years’ time, K-pop’s presence on the midyear Boxscore has more than tripled.\nMany K-Pop Labels Pivot to Live Amid Rising RevenueAll artists appear for SMTOWN Live 2025 in Los Angeles, CaliforniaPress/Photo Courtesy of SM Entertainment\n\nThese touring triumphs highlight a strategic pivot among South Korea’s entertainment giants.\nAs the industry’s reliably massive album sales have softened, live performances have become the primary driver of growth. Major players, including HYBE, SM Entertainment, and YG Entertainment, reported first-quarter revenue surges, primarily driven by concert earnings.\n\n\nCheck out a breakdown of the year-over-year first-quarter numbers for each of the “big four” Korean-pop agencies below, with data provided by The Chosun Daily.\n\n HYBE: Recording an overall 38.7% revenue spike to $365 million, concert revenue soared 252% to $112.4 million, overtaking music sales (which declined 5.9%). Concerts now account for 31% of total revenue, compared to 12% a year earlier. J-Hope helped the company crank a milestone in the U.S. as the first K-pop soloist to perform a stateside stadium with his April 4 and 6 shows at BMO Stadium that grossed $8.8 million from brought in 42,800 attendees for ticket prices ranging from $59.50 to $279.50.\n  \n   HYBE’s 2024 and 2025 tour revenue included shows by SEVENTEEN, BTS’ j-hope, ENHYPEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, LE SSERAFIM, BOYNEXTDOOR, &TEAM and more.\n  \n SM Entertainment: Saw concert revenue climb 58% to $28.3 million, while album and digital sales still managed to rise 23% to $49.1 million.\n  \n   SM’s 2024 and 2025 tour revenue included shows by TVXQ!, Super Junior’s Yesung, Girls’ Generation’s Taeyeon, SHINee’s Minho, NCT 127, NCT DREAM, NCT WISH, aespa and more. SM is also celebrating its 30th anniversary with its all-label SMTOWN Live concert across select cities around the world.\n  \n YG Entertainment: Posted the biggest jump among the four with a 275% year-on-year increase in concert revenue, hitting $5.4 million.\n  \n   YG’s 2024 and 2025 tour revenue included shows by 2NE1, TREASURE, BABYMONSTER and more.\n  \n JYP Entertainment: An outlier with a modest 3.1% revenue uptick to 140.8 billion won with a 41.6% drop in operating profit due to scaled-down tours and heavier investment in new debuts, the company’s concert revenue shrank by 26.5%, with concerts making up about 15% of the quarter’s revenue.\n  \n   JYP’s 2024 and 2025 tour revenue included shows by DAY6, NMIXX, Xdinary Heroes and more.\n  \n\nThe Rest of 2025 Should Bring Bigger K-Pop Live NumberBang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. of Stray Kids perform at the ... More 2024 Billboard Music Awards. (Photo by JYP Entertainment/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty Images\nWith still a month to go until July, the remainder of 2025 appears to be shaping up as a landmark period for further live and touring growth.\nAs further evidence, HYBE CEO Jason Jaesang Lee noted in a recent earnings call that the conglomerate has more than 150 concerts confirmed for 2025 from its artists, with additional announcements to follow. “Both the scale and audience size will expand further in the second half,” Park said, per Chosun Daily.\nOnce again, peep the 2025 preview for the four major agencies.\n\n HYBE’s ongoing world tours as BTS members return: With mandatory military service completed in June for the remaining five members, BTS is reportedly expected to reconvene later this year, potentially fueling a major reunion tour. In the meantime, the eldest member, Jin, will embark on a world tour with dates across Asia, North America, and Europe this summer as j-hope closes out his ongoing solo trek. ENHYPEN’s Walk the Line world tour will wrap its Asia dates in June before setting off to the States and Europe, while LE SSERAFIM has teased North American dates for their Easy Crazy Hot Tour in September.\n SM books global festivals amid a mix of tours: aespa confirmed playing major international summer festivals like Morocco’s Mawazine and Tokyo’s Summer Sonic, with aespa also returning to Los Angeles for KCON 2025 LA with SHINee’s KEY, NCT 127 and RIIZE. Meanwhile, NCT DREAM and RIIZE will be on tour throughout the year, while some of the label’s soloists, like KAI of EXO, and units like Red Velvet’s Irene and Seulgi, will also hold concerts overseas. The company’s 30th anniversary celebration concert, SMTOWN Live, will also feature additional shows in 2025, following dates previous dates in Seoul, Mexico City, and Los Angeles.\n YG’s big BLACKPINK comeback: The label’s top earner is displaying its sustained drawing power with large amounts of tickets sold for stadium shows even as the group has yet to drop any new music. The label’s latest girl group, BABYMONSTER, will also continue its world tour with more U.S. dates after initially starting in New York and Los Angeles earlier this year.\n JYP plays its pair of aces: Both TWICE and Stray Kids have major tours in the pipeline. The girl group will mark their 10th anniversary with a full-length album and an expected tour. Meanwhile, Stray Kids will continue to build on their April momentum, which included a Number 3 spot on Billboard Boxscore’s April 2025 report, after grossing $35 million from six shows and attracting 313,000 attendees as part of the dominATE World Tour. SKZ’s two-night stand at Mexico City’s Estadio GNP Seguros (on April 26–27) alone pulled in $14.1 million from 110,000 tickets sold between $48.91–$225.16. Earlier in the month in São Paulo, they also grossed $10.5 million from another 110,000 attendees, with tickets ranging from $40.16 to $160.64.\n\nWith unprecedented midyear grosses and Korean agencies realigning and diverting resources toward lucrative global tours, the K-pop industry’s blockbuster second half indicates its revenue mix is likely shifting even more toward live performances and, with that, setting new records around the world.\n"

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 05: Lisa attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City.  (Photo by Theo Wargo/FilmMagic)FilmMagic\nLisa has enjoyed historic success on a handful of Billboard’s radio tallies as a soloist. A few tunes from her debut album released under her own alter ego have reached the pop lists in the past few months, but until this week, she had never managed to appear on the all-style, all-encompassing Radio Songs chart.\n\n\nThanks to her most recent collaboration, the Blackpink superstar finally lands on that list — and with her arrival, she joins several of her bandmates in a historic showing.\n\nLisa Hits the Radio Songs Chart\nLisa earns her first hit on Billboard's Radio Songs chart this week alongside Maroon 5. The two musical acts launch \"Priceless\" at No. 45 on the 50-spot roster, which ranks the tracks that rack up the largest total number of audience impressions across all formats in the United States.\n\n\nLisa Joins Jennie and Rosé\nLisa is just the third K-pop solo female musician to appear on the Radio Songs chart. She’s originally from Thailand, and not all of the music she’s created can be classified as K-pop, but she is usually associated with that style due to her years as a member of Blackpink.\n\nThe only two other solo women from that genre who have scored a hit on the Radio Songs tally are some of her Blackpink bandmates. Jennie became the first to do so when she joined The Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp on “One of the Girls.” That track spent just three frames on the Radio Songs chart and only climbed to No. 48.\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nRosé matched – and then surpassed – Jennie in this feat in late 2024 alongside Bruno Mars with “Apt.” That catchy cut has skyrocketed to No. 4 in the 27 frames it has spent somewhere on the list. It still stands as the highest-rising hit ever by any K-pop musical artist. So far, only Blackpink singer Jisoo has missed out on this ranking.\n\n\"Priceless\" Is Becoming a Radio Smash\n\"Priceless\" is quickly becoming a true radio smash in America, as the cut has now spent three weeks on both the Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay tallies. This frame, it lifts to Nos. 19 and 11, respectively, on those rosters. Just last time around, it debuted at No. 29 on the Adult Contemporary roster, and this week, it pushes forward one spot. In each instance, the poppy collaboration reaches a new high point.\n\n\n"

Sin embargo, esta vez se enfrentan a una amenaza sin precedentes: una boy band rival que, en realidad, es un grupo de demonios camuflados dispuestos a conquistarlo todo gracias a su encanto diabólico.Grandes nombresEl reparto de voces incluye a Arden Cho (Teen Wolf), May Hong (Tales of the City), Ji-young Yoo (Until Dawn), Ahn Hyo-seop, Byung Hun Lee (El juego del calamar), Daniel Dae Kim, Ken Jeong, Joel Kim Booster y Yunjin Kim. Además, las miembros de TWICE Jeongyeon, Jihyo y Chaeyoung también participan poniendo voz a personajes y han grabado una canción original titulada Takedown, que suena en el tráiler.Ver en NetflixKpop Demon Hunters está dirigida por Maggie Kang (codirectora de Los Minions: El origen de Gru) y Chris Appelhans (El dragón de los deseos), con guion coescrito junto a Danya Jimenez y Hannah McMechan (Gabby Duran: Alien total). La cinta está producida por Michelle Wong y respaldada por Sony Pictures Animation, el mismo estudio detrás de Spider-Man: un nuevo universo y Los Mitchell contra las máquinas."

    "description": "These 20 YouTube videos didn’t just go viral—they *defined* the internet. From unexpected laughs to unforgettable dances, they prove that sometimes the most random moments make the biggest impact. Ready for a nostalgia trip? Let’s jump in!",
    "url": "https://webdesignerdepot.com/20-most-iconic-youtube-videos-of-all-time/",
    "full_text": "YouTube isn’t just where you go to waste hours watching random stuff—it’s the birthplace of viral moments that have changed the internet forever.Since 2005, we’ve witnessed everything from accidental genius to epic fails, and some of the weirdest, most random clips have become global sensations.Why do these videos matter? Because they show us that anyone can go viral—whether it’s a toddler biting a finger, a confused dentist patient, or a dancing horse-riding guy in Seoul. These videos taught us that on the internet, all you need is the right moment (and maybe a little bit of luck).So, buckle up and let’s relive 20 videos that took over the world and made YouTube what it is today!1. “Me at the Zoo” (The First Ever YouTube Video)Why It’s Iconic: The very first video uploaded to YouTube, “Me at the Zoo,” features co-founder Jawed Karim standing in front of elephants at the San Diego Zoo. While it’s simple—just a 19-second clip—it holds immense historical significance. This unassuming video marked the beginning of YouTube’s journey, a journey that would go on to revolutionize how we consume and share video content. 2. “Charlie Bit My Finger”Why It’s Iconic: Before YouTube became a hub for high-production content, “Charlie Bit My Finger” was one of the first viral family moments that captured the innocence of childhood. It’s a simple video of a toddler (Charlie) biting his older brother’s finger, and their hilarious interaction became one of the earliest viral hits. It’s relatable, pure, and captured that genuine family humor that made YouTube feel like a window into everyone’s everyday life. 3. “Gangnam Style” by PsyWhy It’s Iconic: When Psy’s “Gangnam Style” debuted, no one could predict that a K-pop song with a quirky dance would break the internet. It became the first video to surpass 1 billion views, redefining the potential for viral music videos. The “horse-riding” dance became a worldwide phenomenon, and even celebrities couldn’t resist taking part in the viral craze. Its infectious beat and choreography made it a cultural staple, even outside the K-pop genre. 4. “Evolution of Dance” by Judson LaipplyWhy It’s Iconic: “Evolution of Dance” is a perfect example of how YouTube could turn a simple idea into something universally loved. Judson Laipply’s ability to impersonate the dances of various decades, combined with his comedic timing, made this video a comedic masterpiece. It became the most-watched video on YouTube in its time and was one of the first videos to reach mass viral popularity before the platform became flooded with content. 5. “Baby Shark Dance” by PinkfongWhy It’s Iconic: Whether you love it or hate it, “Baby Shark” has made its mark. This catchy tune, with its simple dance moves, has become a favorite for children worldwide. Its viral success on YouTube catapulted it into the most-watched video of all time in 2020, surpassing even “Despacito.” The song is a cultural touchstone for kids, and it’s also a testament to the power of simple, repetitive, and highly engaging content. 6. “David After Dentist”Why It’s Iconic: This short, yet unforgettable video captures the post-dental surgery confusion of a young boy named David. His loopy, wide-eyed reactions to the anesthesia quickly became a source of endless memes and remixes. The rawness and sincerity of his confusion turned an everyday experience into one of the most widely-shared videos in internet history. 7. “Sneezing Baby Panda”Why It’s Iconic: Panda videos are always adorable, but this one stands out because of the panda’s perfectly-timed sneeze. The look of surprise on its face made this video an immediate favorite, and the fact that it was so short and sweet made it perfect for repeat views. It embodies the viral power of animal clips and is one of the first to truly capture the viral essence of YouTube. 8. “The Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger”Why It’s Iconic: This video turned a simple animal documentary into a full-blown comedic masterpiece. The narration, delivered with over-the-top attitude and humor, led to the now-famous “Honey Badger don’t care” catchphrase, which quickly became part of internet lexicon. It’s a perfect example of how YouTube allowed regular people to create viral content that could rival traditional media. 9. “Rickroll” (Rick Astley – “Never Gonna Give You Up”)Why It’s Iconic: The Rickroll is the ultimate internet prank, and it wouldn’t exist without the unexpected success of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.” This music video, originally a 1980s hit, became a bait-and-switch meme, where unsuspecting viewers are lured into watching it under false pretenses. It’s a staple of internet culture and is still used as a joke today. 10. “Leave Britney Alone” by Chris CrockerWhy It’s Iconic: This emotional rant by Chris Crocker defending Britney Spears became one of YouTube’s first viral moments. It was raw, dramatic, and hilarious in its own way, leading to widespread parody, yet it also sparked a conversation about celebrity culture and internet bullying. Crocker’s over-the-top delivery turned a heartfelt plea into a viral sensation. 11. “Nyan Cat”Why It’s Iconic: “Nyan Cat” is pure internet whimsy: a cat with a pop-tart body flying through space while leaving a rainbow trail behind it. The absurdity and repetition made it both annoying and lovable, and it quickly became a meme that spread far beyond YouTube, featuring in remixes, parodies, and even video games. It’s an example of how a simple concept can become a cultural touchstone. 12. “What Does the Fox Say?” by YlvisWhy It’s Iconic: “What Does the Fox Say?” is an absurdly catchy song by the Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis. The outlandish lyrics, combined with a quirky music video, became an international phenomenon. The song’s comedic and nonsensical approach made it one of the most memorable viral hits in recent years. 13. “Double Rainbow”Why It’s Iconic: The man’s emotional reaction to witnessing a double rainbow struck a chord with viewers. His over-the-top wonder and awe were both hilarious and heartwarming, making it one of the earliest examples of the “wow” viral content that YouTube is known for. The phrase “What does it mean?” quickly entered the meme lexicon. 14. “Shit Girls Say”Why It’s Iconic: A satirical take on the things women supposedly say, “Shit Girls Say” became a viral sensation thanks to its clever humor and accurate observations about female speech. This video spawned countless parodies and led to a series of viral videos that highlighted quirky behaviors and stereotypes. 15. “Damn Daniel”Why It’s Iconic: The “Damn Daniel” video, featuring Daniel’s friends shouting “Damn Daniel!” in reaction to his white Vans, became a viral sensation due to its simplicity and catchphrase. The video became a meme and was featured in multiple TV appearances, cementing its place in viral video history. 16. “Harambe – Dicks Out For Harambe”Why It’s Iconic: Harambe the gorilla’s death became the focus of a massive internet movement, leading to memes, merchandise, and even a movement calling for “Dicks Out for Harambe.” The video has become emblematic of how the internet can turn a tragic event into a meme phenomenon that stays in the public consciousness for years. 17. “Salt Bae”Why It’s Iconic: Turkish chef Nusret Gökçe, also known as Salt Bae, became an internet sensation after a video of him sprinkling salt in an extravagant fashion went viral. His dramatic gesture—flicking his fingers while salting food—became a meme and was widely parodied, showcasing how a small moment can go viral and become global. 18. “The Dress”Why It’s Iconic: This viral debate over whether a dress was blue and black or white and gold captured the world’s attention and sparked intense debate across social media platforms. The dress became a symbol of how perception can vary, and it remains one of the most memorable viral moments in internet history. 19. “The Ultimate Dog Tease”Why It’s Iconic: The “Ultimate Dog Tease” video became a viral sensation thanks to its witty voiceover, which paired perfectly with a dog’s facial expressions, making it appear as if the dog was reacting to the conversation. It’s an early example of the humor that would dominate viral videos on the platform. 20. “Kony 2012”Why It’s Iconic: The “Kony 2012” campaign was a short film meant to raise awareness about Joseph Kony and the atrocities committed by the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda. Though the campaign sparked controversy, it became a massive viral sensation and is one of the most significant moments of YouTube’s potential for social impact. These videos represent the diversity of content that makes YouTube so special: from heartwarming family moments to laugh-out-loud viral hits, emotional pleas for celebrity support to humorous animal antics.They demonstrate how a single video, whether well-planned or totally spontaneous, can explode across the internet and become part of our shared cultural lexicon.YouTube, in all its unpredictable glory, continues to be a space where anyone’s content can go viral—making it a truly global stage for creativity and expression.Simon SterneSimon Sterne is a staff writer at WebdesignerDepot.

    "url": "http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/scoups-seventeen-boss-met-gala-2025-1237687664/",
    "full_text": "\n\tOn Monday, new Boss global ambassador S.Coups attended the Met Gala wearing a custom look inspired by a Korean hanbok jeogori jacket, with a matching gray wool flannel blazer with hanbok double-breasted collar and coordinating stand-collar shirt. The look was accessorized with gray wool heeled boots, and a Piaget diamond watch.\n\n\n\n\n\t“Working with S.Coups has been a very smooth process,” said Boss creative director Marco Falcioni of the brand’s first collaboration with the musician, who was named an ambassador late last month.  \n\n\n\n\n\t“The conversation was very much about what does tailoring mean for S.Coups,” Falcioni said, adding that he aimed to create a tailored look that would resonate with both the brand’s DNA and S.Coups. The conversation quickly turned to the hanbok, and the team decided to design an outfit informed by the construction and proportions of the traditional Korean garment. “ We were able to create something which was new to us [Boss], new for S.Coups, and resonated well for both.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGoing into Monday’s Met Gala, S.Coups was looking forward to the moment he stepped out on the red carpet to debut the outfit. “I hope to be seen as an embodiment of Boss’ captivating style and aesthetic,” said S.Coups. “I’m also excited to see all the amazing looks and how everyone will bring their own unique take to the event.” Here, the Seventeen leader reflects on beginning his journey as a Boss ambassador, and an upcoming milestone for the K-pop group and himself.\n\n\n\n\n\tWWD: Why were you excited to attend the Met Gala this year? S.Coups: The Met Gala is such a significant night that brings fashion and art together, and it felt like a great chance to broaden my perspective. As a Boss ambassador, I was also eager to see the expertise and craftsmanship behind their suits firsthand. \n\n\n\n\n\tWWD: What do you appreciate about your Boss look, and how is it setting the tone for the evening? S.Coups: It’s a custom-tailored look inspired by jeogori, the Korean hanbok jacket, so it fits me perfectly and highlights a creative design — like the contrasting shades of gray on the inside and outside of the coat that add a subtle allure when revealed with each step. It really sets the tone for this year’s Met, which celebrates “tailoring” as a form of self-expression and individuality. \n\n\n\n\n\tWWD: What has been rewarding about working with Boss as their newest global brand ambassador?S.Coups: It’s truly an honor to start my journey with Boss at my first Met Gala, and I’m filled with excitement and anticipation to share even more exciting collaborations in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\tWWD: How would you describe your style offstage?S.Coups: I tend to prefer comfortable clothes. Since I often wear stage outfits and need to prepare for dance practices, I naturally gravitate toward more comfortable options.\n\n\n\n\n\tWWD: You guys [Seventeen] are getting ready to release your fifth album “Happy Burstday” later this month. What can fans look forward to with this new release and the summer ahead?S.Coups: We’re all pumped up and ready to give it our all for this album and performance. It feels like a grand way to close out my 20s. The album will be released on our 10th anniversary, May 26, so I hope you’ll give it lots of love, and look forward to sharing the next 10 years with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "description": "Fresh off a landmark Coachella performance, and with a global tour on the horizon, the award-winning K-pop group tell us why their new EP, DESIRE : UNLEASH, is their most important yet",
    "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/66940/1/enhypen-global-superstardom-k-pop-coachella-korea-desire-unleash?utm_source=Link&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=RSSFeed&utm_term=enhypen-are-ready-for-global-superstardom",
    "full_text": "\n\nIn April, ENHYPEN played Coachella with a set spanning the combative (“Future Perfect (Pass The MIC)”) to the ethereal (“Moonstruck”). Fan favourites like “ParadoXXX Invasion” and “Blockbuster” were rearranged into even chunkier beasts, the live band cranking up the tension. “Drunk-Dazed” became a pounding rave. The audience swelled for their second weekend, and amid the dust and whipping winds, Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Sunghoon, Jake, Sunoo and Ni-ki, whose records now regularly sell over a million copies, delivered an unspoken yet clear-cut message: ENHYPEN are ready for superstardom. \nThree days before this interview, Jay went live on the social platform Weverse. Self-aware and erudite, the 23-year-old sat in a small practice room, his beloved guitars behind him, and told Engenes (ENHYPEN’s fandom) that he believed 2025 and their new EP, DESIRE : UNLEASH, to be the most important of their career. \nThe tipping point Jay’s referring to feels very real. Now in their fifth year, with an acclaimed Coachella set under their belts, a growing awards list, a US tour (their fourth) scheduled for August followed by European arena dates (their first), and their sixth EP in hand, their ambitions are palpable. “We're going to be trying a lot of new things, performance-wise,” Jay tells Dazed over Zoom. “We’re showcasing a never-before-seen face of ENHYPEN.”\n\n\n\nPrior to the EP’s release, there were glimpses of this new ENHYPEN via four conceptual shoots (MAKE, YOU, MINE, and ENGENE) and a concept cinema video that teased the record’s exploration of desire and ruin set within the band’s ongoing vampiric lore. Mentioning MAKE elicits little snorts of laughter from Jake, Jay, and the band’s leader, Jungwon. “I definitely thought it was very daring but it tied in very well with the overarching concept,” says Jay, with no pun intended. “It brought something new to the table.” \nThey’re aware that the fandom lost their collective minds upon seeing the members in leather shackles and shibari, their skin sprouting thorns and branded with phrases like ‘Monster In Me’ and Make Mine’, a knife being licked, a hacksaw, mace, and chainsaw in hand. They saw the responses, from thirsty to surreal, on social media. “I did look at a lot of fan edits and one of them included me pulling a cow, which was very memorable,” says Jungwon, who, amused, ended up personally responding to the said bovine edit.\nBut, humour aside, DESIRE : UNLEASH is, Jake says, “where we talk about loving someone but also wanting to destroy them. Ever since our debut EP, we’ve talked about two opposite but connected things, and the times in life where you come across making a choice [between them]. When there’s good on one side, there’s bad [on the other], there’s evil and there’s happiness, and the topic of desire always changes when we put out an album. [This EP] might be a bit extreme, like, no one's gonna have the kind of desires that we talk about,” he says with a laugh. “But it puts it at a level where it’s more interesting or appealing to listeners. And I think people can relate to it in a way. Everyone has desires within, and everyone goes through a time where they have to fight them.”  \n\n\nCourtesy of ENHYPEN\n\nENHYPEN’s overarching lore has always been most fascinating when you flip the vampiric story (trying not to fight the darkness, taming the desire for blood, and experiencing human love and loss, in a nutshell) and view it through the lens of fame: transitioning from the norm to an idol, decadence and temptation, the loss of control and battle to regain it, and the cost of an ever-present hunger for more. \nYou might wonder if such a consuming and ever-expanding narrative has shaped, or in fact been reflective of, the band’s growing understanding of themselves as people and idols. But, explains Jungwon, this has come entirely independent of the world-building encircling them. “Our lore and us as artists are two separate things. When we’re onstage, we’re not focused on trying to explain our lore, we’re not consciously thinking of the Dark Moon universe, we’re performers and we just want to pull off that performance in the best way possible. The same goes for when we’re in the studio. The lore is an added excitement for the fans to have more fun with, and when we’re on stage we just focus on what we need to do best.” \nENHYPEN will always be the first to admit they’re still learning and refining their craft. After wrapping up Coachella, Heeseung described their set as “perfect”, which he’s now a little sheepish about. “Looking back, me saying that it was perfect was a kind of spur-of-the-moment thing because I was really hyped up,” he laughs. “There are definitely some things we could have done better, but it was the most gratifying stage I’ve done in my career. Coachella is going to be a new benchmark for us in putting together more impressive stages, not just for me but the entire group.”\nSome days and some sessions are easier than others. Take “Flashover”, the new EP’s future bass banger, which was super straightforward to embody, says Sunoo: “It blew me away when I first heard it. It’s really intense and it left a very strong impression as the first track.” \nWhereas the lead single “Bad Desire (With or Without You)” presented a conundrum for Sunghoon: “It was a little tricky to wrap my head around in terms of its substance and, in many ways, I was a bit stuck on how I should go about this song.” Getting unstuck was a case of “just singing it again and again,” he adds, as his bandmates laugh. “We tried a lot of different things, like adjusting the key and so forth and over the course of that, it came to me.”\n\n\n\nOne of the most in-demand groups in the business, last year alone they released their second studio album, ROMANCE : UNTOLD, its repackage (ROMANCE : UNTOLD - daydream -), an EP (Memorabilia), toured seven countries for five months with two different productions, attended a Prada show (for whom they’re ambassadors) in Milan, filmed their own YouTube variety show and countless brand and media shoots. Unable to spend weeks testing and tweaking material in the studio, they’ve instead developed the ability to adapt and adopt, and be damn fast at it.\n“These days we get recording done pretty quickly,” says Sunghoon. \nAdds Jungwon: “For this particular title track, it really took a short amount of time. We only recorded two or three times, I think.”\nSo, hypothetically, ENHYPEN’s superpower at this point could be to knock out, say, a two-disc mega concept album in a day? \n“One [working] day is too much of a stretch. We’d take more than that,” says Sunoo, half-smiling, half in the realm of ‘aw hell, no’ .\nHeeseung laughs: “Maybe if they caged us up and all we did for 24 hours straight was record? Maybe.”\nThere is an inherent genrelessness to K-pop, with albums running the entire gamut of popular music where synth-pop can sit next to a soft, treacly ballad, next to a smoky R&B jam. Done without care, it floats adrift on an identity crisis. ENHYPEN’s circumvented that risk with an infrastructure on their EPs – an experimental intro, a decadent lead single and an equally extravagant, so-good-it-could-be-lead-single track, a mid-tempo singalong, a curveball, and a definitive closer – which guides the listener from record to record and, for the band, creates a stable platform from which they can build out and play with sound. \nDESIRE : UNLEASH is no exception to this design – “Each track is distinctive, each song has a different meaning and reason for why it’s there, which makes it even more exciting when we’re in the booth, so I hope you’ll savour how they’re one of a kind,” says Heeseung – even as it makes no bones about being their most grown-up record. Eight tracks over 17 minutes is short but in this time it’s dominant, pleading, lovesick, besotted, tormented, and unabashedly horny. \n\nWe’ve never done a real hip hop song. It might lead to a bigger spectrum of music for us, I think this is a starting point.\n– Jake, ENHYPEN\n\nDuring a recent US interview, Jay described the EP as “shocking”. On the shuddering “Bad Desire (With or Without You)”, melancholia entwines with basic instinct (‘A heaven without you must be like hell… a hell where I embrace you must be like heaven… Tell me all your deepest, all your bad desires’). “Too Close” softens its voracious appetite – ’All the cravings I kept down, it feels like they’re awakening’ – with jazzy lounge piano, while the lyrics for “Outside” run thus: ‘Was a pretty boy but it’s getting ugly, The sounds of my desire hit me, like they’re breaking my head, No virtue signaling, just wanna have you, Angels and demons up all night’. Jungwon grins: “I think fans will be able to understand where Jay is coming from.” \nLet's pause on “Outside” for a moment. Sampling Three 6 Mafia’s “Stay Fly”, it’s their first concerted foray into hip hop, a genre minimally explored by previous tracks “Blockbuster”, “Future Perfect (Pass The MIC)” and “Daydream”. ENHYPEN – who are somewhat sleepy because it’s morning and they’re in the thick of the hectic final dash to release day – perk up. Jake, fuelled on iced cornsilk tea and snacks, describes “Outside” as ’interesting and charismatic’. “We’ve never done something like this before, a real hip hop song,” he explains. “We have a session where we all listen to the songs, we talk about what we want to put on the album and as soon as we heard this, we knew it suited the whole colour of this album. It might lead to a bigger spectrum of music for us, and I think this is a starting point.”\n\n\nCourtesy of ENHYPEN\n\nOwnership of their work increasingly stretches beyond being merely performers. Previously, Ni-ki has contributed choreography, all the band has penned lyrics, and Heeseung co-wrote and co-produced “Highway 1009” for their last album. On DESIRE : UNLEASH, it’s Jay’s debut as a songwriter/producer, teaming up with FRANTS who worked on last year’s countrified EDM banger, “Teeth” (unarguably one of their finest deep cuts). Jay’s “Helium” shares its galloping, urgent cadence but leans in one of his great loves – rock music – with guitar (which he, too, played) squalling across its back half, tag-teaming with Heeseung’s soaring ad-libs.\n“FRANTS is a person I feel very comfortable around so we’ve been working on a few songs together,” says Jay, who adds that his starting point is simple “curiosity” around a certain sound and “my desire to have more of those [types of] songs. “When I thought about helium I thought not about lightness but how a balloon full of helium will fly really high into the atmosphere, and I decided to liken that to a person’s love towards me, which really lifts me up to that high place.”\nNo ENHYPEN record would be complete without the inclusion of their numerous lyrical and visual motifs – the moon, monsters, fate, blood, binding, and lines, to name but a few – offering a meticulous, satisfying exercise in connecting the dots past and present. “We’ve been working on this lore since debut and I’m fascinated by finding tiny things that tie in with our older concepts and overarching themes. A lot of attention goes into our videos and album props, the little pieces here and there that allow Engene to make their own interpretations and enjoy it in every way,” says Ni-ki, flagging, as an example, his custom fang grillz in their new video, where he bites his second self in a scene reminiscent of a previous ENHYPEN choreography. “I’m impressed how our [record] company doesn't try to keep us in a comfort zone but stretches the theme in different ways.”\nBut, as is the way with any new release, ENHYPEN find themselves facing that wily, unpredictable path towards the future. And with a title like DESIRE : UNLEASH, there’s only one thing left to ask… What is it they desire next? \n“I definitely have desires for ENHYPEN to reach new heights, and my personal dreams into which I try to channel positive energy so all this can be a stepping stone for a big leap forward,” says Sunghoon. He ponders the contents of those dreams under his breath for a long moment, then laughs at himself for overthinking his reply. “I’m talking about me becoming a better person who goes further as a human being.”\n“I try not to read into it too much, I just want to be a cooler artist with a lot of energy and potential, and to create more music packed with emotions that a wider audience can relate to,” adds Heeseung. \nAs for Jake, the soft-spoken, Australia-raised member of the group, he offers up a wide, easy-going grin. “Desire doesn't have to be extreme, so mine would be just meeting our fans all over the world more often, and having a really, really great time.”\nDESIRE : UNLEASH is out today (June 5)\n\n"

    "title": "Big Ocean breaks new ground as K-pop’s first deaf group",
    "description": "Big Ocean, the world’s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
    "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/k-pop-big-ocean-deaf-south-korea-b2760623.html",
    "full_text": "Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance — one beat at a time.When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity — vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea’s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, “Underwater,” which dropped on April 20.PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop’s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes — flashing light guides displayed on monitors — to help stay in sync when audio alone isn’t enough.Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.Dancing to visual cues “We each felt rhythm differently when dancing,” PJ told The Associated Press. “So when we’d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.”This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. “When we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,” said Jiseok. “But we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation — just like we practiced.”Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. “When a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can’t see the stage movements in front of us,” PJ said. “Our concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.”“When there’s no clear beat in a song, it’s really hard for us to stay synchronized,” Jiseok said. “When the bass is overwhelming, it’s difficult for us to catch it accurately.”Promoting accessibility Despite these challenges, Big Ocean’s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean’s global fanbase — known as PADO — has responded with similar commitment.“While communicating with PADO, we’ve heard that they’re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,” Jiseok said. “When we see how much they’re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.”The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.Jiseok credits BTS’s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM’s donation to his former school — a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students — gave him access to music and dance for the first time. “Without those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,” he said.Fostering collaboration Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.“We recently saw Justin Bieber’s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,” PJ said. “All of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I’d also love to work with Billie Eilish.”As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.“I’ve always liked playing it safe — even with food, I only ate what I was used to,” he said. “But through Big Ocean, I’ve gained confidence in trying new things. That’s what I’m most satisfied with.”"

There were indeed dozens of faces embroidered across her translucent black-lace jacket and strapless bodysuit from Louis Vuitton (LV) — but these likenesses were all created by contemporary artist Henry Taylor, and Rosa Parks was not among them.Though Lisa has yet to speak out on the matter after countless news reports and viral social media posts, Hyperallergic confirmed that the lacy ensemble bore the faces of people close to Taylor — friends, family members, acquaintances — as is also typical of the artists’s signature paintings, which foreground Black individuals in intimate and community settings. The bespectacled portrait on Lisa’s body suit that many mistook for Parks is actually of the artist’s neighbor.Installation view of Henry Taylor: B Side at the Whitney Museum of American Art (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)Taylor had collaborated with Met Gala Co-Chair Pharrell Williams in 2023 for the latter’s debut collection upon his appointment as LV’s creative director for menswear. The artist provided the fashion house with samples of his existing portraiture, which in turn converted them into micro-embroidered embellishments that appeared on some of Pharrell’s collection looks. Taylor also painted Pharrell’s portrait for the cover of Vogue’s May issue.Taylor also attended last night’s Met Gala, which was themed “Tailored For You” to celebrate the Superfine: Tailoring Black Style exhibition. He was styled by Pharrell, and wore a white button-down featuring his own embroidered portraits.Henry Taylor at the Met Gala on May 5, 2025, wearing a shirt printed with his portraits (photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)Pharrell also styled Lisa for the gala, along with rising popstar Sabrina Carpenter, Grammy-winning breakout rapper Doechii, and actor Jeremy Allen White. Lisa’s custom look deployed the same portraits included in Pharrell’s debut collection, except they were presented as black outlines rather than colorful embroidery.This controversy comes months after alleged videos of Lisa and other members of Blackpink reciting the N-word while singing along to several songs during their training days were leaked and shared across social media, adding fuel to the recent fire. The group has not issued an official statement about the controversy.\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

The group is the latest in K-pop to market multiculturalism in a cutthroat industry.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  1Verse is the first K-pop group in the world to feature North Korean defectors. Its other members have roots in Laos, Thailand, China, Japan and the U.S. They're the latest K-pop idols to market multiculturalism in this cutthroat industry. Haeryun Kang tells us more about this unusual group from Seoul.HAERYUN KANG: (Non-English language spoken).1VERSE: (Non-English language spoken).KANG: When I meet 1Verse at their agency in Gangnam, a ritzy district in Seoul, the first thing I ask is how they overcome language barriers.SEOK KIM: (Non-English language spoken).(LAUGHTER)KANG: Body language. That's vocalist Seok Kim, one of the North Korean members.HYUK YU: Hello. My name is Hyuk. I'm from North Korea. I'm the rapper of 1Verse.KANG: There's also the main dancer, Aito Murata from Japan, Nathan Kousol, a Lao Thai computer science major from Arkansas and last but not least...KENNY HAO: Hi, my name is Kenny Hao. I'm from California, and I'm the personality hire (laughter).KANG: This kind of diversity is no longer unusual in K-pop. Now, they all live together in a dorm in Seoul, chasing the K-pop dream.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ORDINARY PERSON\")1VERSE: (Rapping) Look, I said I wonder who I'd be, 'cause heaven ain't for me.KANG: The five members, who go professionally by their first names, all listened to different music as kids. Kenny grew up with The Beatles. Aito loved Justin Bieber. Nathan listened to Lao and Thai music. And the North Koreans?KIM: (Speaking Korean).KANG: Seok, who defected in 2019, listened to K-pop, illegally downloaded on USBs. He's from Ryanggang province, bordering China, where foreign goods are smuggled in more easily. But Hyuk lived much further inland in Kyongsong, a poorer region.YU: (Speaking Korean).KANG: Starting when he was just 9 years old, Hyuk cut down trees and even stole to survive, he says. Music was a luxury. The little he heard was state-sanctioned, like this revolution song.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)1VERSE: (Singing in non-English language).KANG: Hyuk was the first trainee to join 1Verse. It took executive producer Michelle Cho six years to find all the members. She tells me about conceiving of the group with her co-founder, Joe Lim.MICHELLE CHO: Joe was thinking about, hey, do you think it'll be cool to, like, do a K-pop group with some North Koreans? Why not? If there's talented enough people, there is no reason why we can't do it.KANG: Back then, Hyuk was working in restaurants and factories. When Michelle Cho met Hyuk, she said she heard talent in his voice. From there, her agency, Singing Beetle, held multiple auditions for the others. For each round, they received hundreds of applications from all over the world, despite being a small agency just starting out.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)1VERSE: (Speaking Korean).KANG: 1Verse already has over half a million followers on TikTok, and their first single isn't even out yet. Online, they're very active, making silly reels, singing cover songs together, like \"Fools\" by Troye Sivan.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FOOLS\")1VERSE: (Singing) Only fools fall for you.YU: (Speaking Korean).KANG: Before defecting, Hyuk had never heard of South Korea, let alone Troye Sivan. He was just 13 in 2013 when he left his hometown, just 200 miles from Seoul, across one of the most fortified borders in the world. Today, he is one of some 30,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ORDINARY PERSON\")1VERSE: (Rapping) How to be one, just like an ordinary person. But can you show me...KANG: This song, \"Ordinary Person,\" was cowritten by Hyuk. He raps in English, true to K-pop's strategy to reach a global audience. This is the only song the group has gone public with, as a teaser. Like other K-pop groups, 1Verse is very secretive about its official debut music. They won't tell me anything - the title, the lyrics, the dates, even the genres. Nathan just cheekily says...NATHAN KOUSOL: We can't wait to share our music (laughter).KANG: We may know their multicultural backstories, but for now, the most important part of 1Verse - their sounds - is up to our imagination.For NPR News, I'm Haeryun Kang from Seoul.\n\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "description": "The newly elected President defeated an increasingly authoritarian rival party. Can he bring the country back together?",
    "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/democracy-wins-a-referendum-in-south-korea",
    "full_text": "Just before 11 P.M. this past December 3rd, the Korean legislator Lee Jae-myung issued a dire warning from a moving car. “My fellow-Koreans, you must come out to the National Assembly,” he said, in a live stream from his phone. The video showed Lee in a dark suit and a royal-blue tie, the color of his Democratic Party. He looked weary and frightened. “Our democracy is collapsing,” he said. “Please come together to protect it.”The nation’s President, Yoon Suk-yeol, who was a prosecutor before being groomed for leadership by the People Power Party, had spent the past few years turning the machinery of the state against political opponents, trade unions, and journalists who criticized him. Now he had declared martial law and sent troops to lock down the parliamentary complex. But Lee and his allies hoped that they could prevail: because of South Korea’s recent history of military dictatorships, its constitution allows the legislature to constrain orders of martial law. The night that Lee issued his call, thousands of citizens showed up at the National Assembly. They helped Democratic Party legislators, and even a few conservatives typically aligned with Yoon, make their way past the soldiers and break into the building to vote down the order. It was an uncommon instance of coöperation across party lines in extreme circumstances—and, I argued at the time, a model for fighting authoritarianism elsewhere.A great deal has happened since. From December through April, there were ecstatic daily protests, demanding that Yoon be ousted. These were followed by Yoon’s impeachment by the National Assembly, his criminal indictment, his formal removal by the Constitutional Court—and, this Tuesday, a snap election to replace him. In the 2022 Presidential election, Lee lost to Yoon by less than one per cent. This time, he won by more than eight points. He will be inaugurated on Wednesday, beginning a five-year term.Lee is sixty-one years old, a scrapper with a potent backstory. He grew up in poverty, in the eastern part of the country, and got a job instead of attending middle school; his left arm was later crushed in a factory accident, causing it to splay at the elbow. He went on to become a human-rights lawyer, a mayor, and the governor of Korea’s most populous province. He has pushed redistributive policies, including universal basic income, while sticking to the Democratic mainstream. He is pro-development and pro-welfare state, loyal to the United States but respectably independent. Last year, he survived an assassination attempt at a public appearance: a man in his sixties, posing as a supporter and wearing a paper crown that read “I am Lee Jae-myung,” plunged a knife into his neck. The attacker had written a screed saying that he intended to save Korea from “left-wing forces.”Lee has been involved in numerous controversies. In the early two-thousands, he was found to have misrepresented himself as a prosecutor to help a journalist investigate a mayor suspected of corruption; he was accused of having an extramarital affair; his son reportedly posted misogynistic comments online. He has faced multiple prosecutions, including one for lying about his relationship to a real-estate developer during an election debate, in 2021. (Korea strictly regulates election-related speech; that case was appealed and is on hold.) The episodes provoked criticism that was often tinged with classist disdain; conservatives described Lee as a “petty criminal” who swims in “dirty waters.” But a liberal friend also surprised me by writing him off as “dangerous” and “too messy” to run the country. Far-right and evangelical groups targeted him for his views, labelling him a “pinko commie” and organizing campaigns to smear him online.In the recent election, Lee’s main rival was Kim Moon-soo, a former labor minister who served as Yoon’s proxy. Kim is not a dynamic presence, but he upheld the party line. In one of three debates, he called Lee the country’s “most corrupt government official.” He argued that Yoon had been driven to declare martial law because Lee and the rest of the Democratic Party had repeatedly blocked legislation in the National Assembly. The People Power Party downplayed the attempted self-coup as a silly misstep. “There was quick action to lift the martial law, and it got lifted, didn’t it?” Kim said in the final debate.I travelled around Korea in the days leading up to the election. In Cheonan, one of Kim’s campaign trucks blared music, while a surrogate shouted slogans through a muffled P.A. system. In Namyangju, a city in the province where Lee was governor, banners read, “A vote in this election is a win for the people” and “Cast your vote to stop the treason!” Early voters in Seoul took selfies outside a polling station; there were long lines and lots of buzz, mostly in Lee’s favor.Nearly eighty per cent of eligible voters turned out—Election Day was a national holiday—but at the polls I visited the mood was subdued. I kept thinking about two other recent elections. The first was the Korean snap election in 2017, to replace President Park Geun-hye. Its contours were nearly identical to this year’s: misconduct by a conservative President, months of mass protests, impeachment, removal, criminal prosecution, and the election of a liberal replacement—Moon Jae-in, who, like Lee, had been a human-rights lawyer. The second was the U.S. election of 2020, which Joe Biden framed as a plebiscite on a dangerously venal leader, and which came just after that year’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the largest in American history. Both Moon and Biden campaigned on who they were not—presenting themselves as antidotes or correctives—while promising not to forget the social movements that brought them to power. Both ended up struggling to hold their country together, let alone effect the changes that their activist supporters had hoped to see.What will come of the resistance to Yoon? The movement—large, diverse, and energetic—was largely sustained by young women, who waved “Impeach Yoon” signs to the beat of K-pop and adapted flashing L.E.D. batons, concertgoers’ accessories, to the purpose of ousting a would-be autocrat. Yoon had made women-bashing a core principle. As a candidate and as President, he had fixated on abolishing South Korea’s gender ministry, and implied that feminism was the cause of many social ills, such as overpriced housing, underemployment among young men, and a record-low fertility rate. He surrounded himself with military generals. In a different world, the Democratic Party would have chosen a woman—perhaps a member of the National Assembly, which is about one-fifth female—to run for President to succeed Yoon, pushing for an omnibus anti-discrimination law that has been a perennial goal of women and minority groups.Instead, Lee largely avoided questions of gender during the campaign, and made no particular appeal to the labor movement or to poor people, constituencies he had previously courted. Determined not to alienate all of Yoon’s supporters, he called himself a “real conservative”—as distinct from the radicals who would institute martial law. Yet, as polls showed him taking a comfortable lead, Lee began to sound more like his old self. “Do you know why they’re against Lee Jae-myung?” he said to a crowd in Cheongju last weekend, referring to himself in the third person. “It’s because Lee Jae-myung is from the periphery. He’s on the side of small and medium-sized businesses, not big corporations. He stands with the poor and working class.”Lee wants to go beyond correcting Yoon’s strongman Presidency. But his victory feels more like a reassertion of reality than a referendum on the values of either major party. It is a vote against Yoon and others who would embrace a return to the military dictatorships of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. “Finally, that day of martial law is over,” said a man who celebrated the results in front of the National Assembly, to the news site Pressian.In office, Lee must contend with an unenviable pile of problems. Though some seventeen million voters got behind him, there is no consensus; the nation is split—by gender, class, and geography—and recovering from a prolonged political trauma, including multiple Presidential impeachments and prosecutions. The other, historic split, from North Korea, continues to inspire an arms buildup and a lingering paranoia over Communism. South Korea’s unemployment rate is around three per cent, but higher for younger workers. About half of the population lives in greater Seoul, for lack of jobs in the provinces. Outside Lee’s campaign headquarters, I attended a rally meant to highlight the precarious conditions of temporary and subcontracted employees; a few days later, a subcontracted worker died in a lathe accident at a power plant that was known to be unsafe. The auto and semiconductor industries, which together supplied more than thirty per cent of Korea’s exports in 2024, have been stunned by Donald Trump’s whipsawing tariffs.Still, Lee has reason to feel optimistic. His win is the sign of a functioning democracy and a refutation of authoritarianism. Late last night, on a stage near the National Assembly, he raised his good arm and pumped a fist to the chants of the crowd. “The people are the masters of this country,” he said. “The President’s job is to bring the people together.” ♦"

The film debuts June 20 on streaming.\nThe logline: “When K-pop superstars Rumi, Mira, and Zoey aren’t selling out stadiums, they’re using their secret identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from ever-present supernatural danger. Together, they must face their biggest threat — an irresistible rival boy band of demons in disguise.”\n\nThe music-heavy film draws heavily on K-pop culture and includes original songs written and produced by Teddy Park, 24, Danny Chung, Ido, Vince, Kush and Dominsuk of TheBlackLabel, and performed by Ejae, Rei Ami, Andrew Choi, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, Samuil Lee, Neckwav, and Jeongyeon, Jihyo, and Chaeyoung of Twice, among others.\n“I have been a fan of these incredible artists and their work for many years,” director Maggie Kang said in a statement, “so it’s a dream come true to have original songs written and produced for our film by legendary talent such as TheBlackLabel. I also couldn’t be more thrilled about our collaboration with Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice. It really legitimizes our film and songs in the K-pop world. It’s proof that we achieved what we set out to do, which is make a real K-Pop group.”\nCo-director Chris Appelhans added, “We have an amazing voice cast, and the range of their performances is what gives the film such an original tone. Byung Hun Lee and Ahn Hyo-seop bring authentic K-drama emotion, while Arden, May and Ji-young blend the charisma of legit K-pop stars with the vulnerability and comedy of real young women juggling a dual life like no other.”\nKPOP is SPA’s first release since 2023’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The studio has previously sold numerous features to Netflix for streaming premieres, including The Mitchells vs. the Machines and Vivo. SPA is also partnering with Netflix for the upcoming release of Genndy Tartakovsky’s Fixed after WBD’s New Line Cinema got cold feet over a planned theatrical release.\n     \n    \n  \n  KEY DETAILS\nDirectors: Maggie Kang, Chris Appelhans\nProducer: Michelle L.M.

Reactions to the post included the comment \"Who's getting this phone bcuz of Felix?\" — which had been liked more than 1,500 times at press time. Samsung first teased the partnership last week with a post showing the silhouette of Lee's face. It asked people to guess who the person might be and promised Starbucks gift cards to 25 people who guessed correctly.The Samsung partnership comes in an exciting year for Lee, who walked the runway for Louis Vuitton's Fall-Winter 2025 show in Paris in March.Lee was named the house's ambassador in 2023 and has become a personal muse of LV's artistic director, Nicolas Ghesquière.Lee said in interviews with Vogue that Ghesquière personally invited him to walk the LV Fall-Winter 2024 show in Paris. Before the March show, the designer said it was a \"big honor\" to have Lee there.This is not the first time Samsung has tapped K-pop talent to promote its products. In 2020, the brand released a special BTS Galaxy phone in collaboration with the Grammy-nominated band, and has featured members of the group in its ads too. And in 2019, Samsung also released limited-edition black and pink products in collaboration with K-Pop girl group Blackpink.Representatives for Samsung and Lee did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      \n      \n        \n    \n    \n    \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                  Samsung\n                \n          \n            \n          \n    \n            \n              \n              \n              \n                  \n                    \n                      Read next\n                    \n                  \n            \n                \n              \n        \n    \n        \n    \n          \n              \n                \n              \n          \n          \n            \n            \n      \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n        \n        \n        \n          Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.\n          \n        \n        \n      "

    "full_text": "\n\tBillie Eilish, Beyoncé and Eminem were just a few of the big winners during the American Music Awards 2025, produced by Dick Clark Productions and broadcast from Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\tEilish won in all seven categories where she was nominated, including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year (“Hit Me Hard and Soft”), Favorite Touring Artist, Favorite Female Pop Artist and Favorite Pop Album (“Hit Me Hard and Soft”). She also won with “Birds of a Feather” for Song of the Year and Favorite Pop Song.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeyoncé picked up two awards, including Favorite Female Country Artist and Favorite Country Album for “Cowboy Carter.” Post Malone secured his first win in the country category, winning Favorite Male Country Artist, while Eminem won his first AMAs in 15 years for Favorite Male Hip-Hop Artist and Favorite Hip-Hop Album (“The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce)”). Gracie Abrams was awarded New Artist of the Year, while Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won Favorite Music Video and Collaboration of the Year for “Die With a Smile.” Gaga separately reigned in Favorite Dance/Electronic Artist, while Mars scored Favorite Male Pop Artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJennifer Lopez returned to host the AMAs for the first time in a decade, opening the evening with a dance medley of 23 of the biggest hits from the past year. Janet Jackson was on hand to accept the Icon Award, giving her first televised performance in seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\tTaking the stage in a white jacket and baggy jeans, she gave a rendition of her hit “Someone to Call My Lover” (featuring a brief mashup with Mariah Carey’s “Shake It Off”). After wrapping with “All For You,” Jackson accepted the Icon Award, stating that fame was never the intended result of making music.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“No disrespect in any way, but I don’t consider myself an icon. My family, myself, our dream wasn’t ever to be famous. We weren’t raised like that. We always had a special love for music, dancing and singing, and fame came with the result of hard work and dedication,” she said. “My story, my family’s story, it’s truly an American story. This would have only happened in America. The one thing that I hope for is that I’ve been an inspiration to others and artists, to follow their dreams and succeed.”\n\n\n\n\n\tRod Stewart was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by five of his children and closed the show with his classic “Forever Young.” “I am absolutely flabbergasted, I didn’t know they were here, my children,” he said during his acceptance speech. “When I started singing in the early 60s, well before all of you lot were here, the reason I got into it was because I had this burning ambition to sing. That’s all I wanted to do. I didn’t want to be rich or famous, and so many years later, I’m here.”\n\n\n\n\n\tBlake Shelton handled the first performance of the night with his song “Stay Country or Die Tryin’,” while Lainey Wilson kept the country streak going with a rendition of her new single “Somewhere Over Laredo.” Gwen Stefani gave a medley of her new single “Swallow My Tears,” accompanied by renditions of “The Sweet Escape” and “Hollaback Girl.” Benson Boone brought the backflips for “Mystical Magical,” while Renee Rapp debuted her new single “Leave Me Alone.” Gloria Estefan gave a medley of “Rhythm is Gonna Get You,” “La Vecina (No Sé Na’)” and “Conga.” Alex Warren sang “Ordinary,” followed by Becky G teaming up with Manuel Turizo for the first performance of their duet “Que Haces.”\n\n\n\n\n\tCheck out the full list of American Music Awards 2025 winners below:\n\n\n\n\n\tARTIST OF THE YEARAriana GrandeBillie Eilish (WINNER)Chappell RoanKendrick LamarMorgan WallenPost

    "description": "Taking K-pop to the places other performers can only dream of, Rosé returns to the BLACKPINK mothership this summer fresh from a record-breaking solo run. But, says your number-one girl, she still has dreams of melting back into the crowd",
    "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/66907/1/rose-interview-blackpink-k-pop-dazed-summer-2025-issue?utm_source=Link&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=RSSFeed&utm_term=rose-what-does-freedom-look-like-to-me-being-anonymous",
    "full_text": "Rosé – The Summer 2025 Issue9 Images\n\nMost pop stars start out as pop fans. Then, if they are determined, agile, pretty and lucky enough, they’ll get to become something like the stars they spent years studying and idolising. Rosé, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, never got to be a superfan. “See, that’s a big thing I don’t think I really got to experience,” she says. \nThe singer, born Roseanne Park to Korean immigrant parents in New Zealand, was raised in Melbourne, Australia, and never had any posters of pop stars on her bedroom walls. She never spammed an idol’s Weverse, never wrote homoerotic fanfic, or queued for hours outside a concert venue. She really only started to learn about music and music culture at 16, right before she was whisked away to a training boot camp in South Korea, undertaking a regime that resembled the assembly-line approaches of 1960s Motown and Brill Building-era pop in the US. Her friends and older sister had only just introduced her to K-pop before she left. “Then I flew to Korea and practised in a basement for four years.” She emerged from it a pop star.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a break from a fitting in Seoul, Korea, Rosé displays all the behaviour you’d come to expect from her maeryeok (distinctive appeal). She smiles warmly, listens intently and forms little love hearts with her hands. She is one of the most instantly likable people I have ever spoken to. She’s wearing a relaxed white tee and dark navy hoodie, her hair falling into two braids with just the right amount of mess and tousle. She makes an effort to slouch against the nothing-coloured couch. Every girl in the world would think they’d die happy if they looked like this.\nShe coughs throughout our call, and even those are immaculate: three-beat hack-hack-hacks into her hoodie sleeve, dab-style, rounded off with a perfectly polite: “I apologise, I hope this isn’t annoying.” She’s in that last stage of a mild virus, following a week with her family (and Hank the dog), as well as a couple of surprise appearances with Coldplay at Goyang Stadium, the 40,000-capacity venue where she’ll perform with BLACKPINK in a couple of months for the opening night of their world tour. She’s hardly said a word this past week; she’s been on vocal rest. In-between silent games of Scrabble with her team, Rosé started learning sign language for the first time. “It’s really fun,” she tells me.\nHer performances with Coldplay, a band who nowadays function like a nu-age, globalising engine of love and harmony, reenergised and inspired Rosé for the tour ahead. Between glam and stage appearances, she watched the show from the wings, seeing how fans reacted to each confetti blast and lighting change. “It gave me a whole new perspective on how it could feel to be a part of a crowd,” she says, an experience Rosé still feels bereft of.\n\nEach of us [in BLACKPINK] has gone out and been inspired and learned so much about ourselves, and now we’re coming back to each other with good energy\n\nBLACKPINK, the biggest girl group in the world, is the most consistent ensemble she’s ever been a part of. Their world tour will follow a year in which each of the four members released their own solo works, and tried to figure out who they were without the collective identity of the band. Each of them, but especially Rosé, used the opportunity to become more earnest in her presentation, trading BLACKPINK’s pyrotechnics and ruthless self-sufficiency for candlelit familiarity. The transition back to BLACKPINK, she says, was easier than anticipated.\nAfter having her neck out as a solo artist and spending the past year promoting her album in the US, she’s now slipping back into muscle memory. “Each of us has gone out and been inspired and learned so much about ourselves, and now we’re coming back to each other with good energy,” she says. While she’s hung out with Jisoo, Jennie and Lisa throughout the year, it’s been several months since she’s seen the BLACKPINK behind-the-scenes staff, many of whom have been with the group since day one. Rosé had tears in her eyes during today’s fitting. \nShe opens her mouth a little and bites her tongue as I continue my line of BLACKPINK questions. She politely tolerates the first few, meeting them with vague responses – it’s approaching May and they’ve not yet begun rehearsal for the tour – before politely interjecting. “Sorry,” she says graciously, “I don’t think I should be the spokesperson as one quarter of the group.” A little disheartened, I scratch off some 25 BLACKPINK-related questions. Album? More tour dates? I’m afraid I can’t tell you.\n\n\nAll clothes SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY VACCARELLOPhotography CAMPBELL ADDY styling AERI YUNAll clothes and accessories SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY VACCARELLOPhotography CAMPBELL ADDY styling AERI YUN\n\nSpeaking for herself, Rosé says that all she does is work. “Lately, it’s been hard to – what’s that word in English? – detach myself and my life from my work.” She has decided to stop feeling apologetic about a lack of work-life balance. “I’ve always felt guilty for bringing work home but if you work until you sleep, I think that’s great. That means you love it. Even when I’m not working, my brain is.” She experiences no moment without purpose. Her life is a constant stream of potential material that she can later edit, condense, scrap, collate, and potentially turn into song.\nShe blurred the line between work and self permanently with last year’s full-length solo release Rosie, an album hinged on romantic weaknesses and dependencies, which showed she might be just as fixated on love as she is on her own career. On it, she traded BLACKPINK’s ideals of hyperachievement for emotional unravelling, insecurity, obsession and neediness. “Tell me lies like ‘we’re OK’, promise ‘til your face turns purple,” she sang on “not the same”. The lyrics were gestural and easy to identify with, in a way that made it feel like collective processing alongside one of the planet’s biggest pop stars. Having mastered singing and dancing, Rosie was her opportunity to master vulnerability. “That was the biggest gift I got to walk away with,” she says. “I feel like I’ve since learned to sit with myself and accept it and be comfortable with it. I’m really, really happy about that, and I think it’s a tool that I picked up on myself. I love it.”\nRosie performed with all the astronomical numbers we’ve come to expect of a K-pop act, but more surprisingly, it ended up in both middle England and America, largely thanks to the ubiquitous and unavoidable “APT”. During a time when every other pop star is promising to “bring the fun back to pop”, “APT” genuinely delivered the whole year 6 disco. With its optimally distinct hook – ap-uh-tuh-puh-tuh – and powerful jocularity, “APT” became fodder for prime-time Radio 2 playlists and TK Maxx in-store music. The little sister of the family isn’t the only one familiar with Rosé any more. Now, the grandma, mum, auntie and baby – especially the baby – are in on it too.\n\nLately, it’s been hard to – what’s that word in English? – detach myself and my life from my work\n\nRosie, which sanded down the usual excesses of K-pop, was a seamless integration into mainstream pop. Bang Si-hyuk, the chairman of Hybe, BTS’s agency, remarked at a US pop culture conference last year that “for K-pop to gain more fans in the global music market, it needs to be consumed more lightly as part of pop music, requiring expansion in both form and content”. Rosie made good on that promise, and ultimately propelled Rosé’s success outside of Korea. Her record-breaking album became the most successful of all time for an artist of K-pop origin in America. It topped the Billboard charts, and is now well on its way to reaching six billion streams. Before the end of the year, Rosé applied to terminate her copyright trust with Korea Music Copyright Association, conceivably to keep expanding her global reach.\nWith a little distance from the rollout of her solo debut, Rosé reflects back on Rosie only according to her own internal metrics. “Whenever I do anything, I always ask, ‘Have I done everything that I wanted to? Is there anything else I could have done?’” With this one, says Rosé, “I couldn’t have done the slightest bit more”. She put her “heart, soul, and more” into it. That fierce work ethic most likely comes from her mother. “I’ve seen her pour her heart out into absolutely everything she does. Growing up, it was amazing watching her work.”\n\n\nAll clothes and accessories SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY VACCARELLOPhotography CAMPBELL ADDY styling AERI YUNTop stylist’s own, wool skirt WHITE ABYSS, leather boots ACNE STUDIOSPhotography CAMPBELL ADDY styling AERI YUN\n\nAt home, her parents spoke almost exclusively in Korean. It wasn’t until she was three, when she started kindergarten in Auckland, New Zealand, that she began speaking English. She grasped the language instinctively, rolling and rounding out her Rs – a rare feature of the Korean language, whose consonants are softened. Now, the two different languages form their own distinctive texture and gravity in her throat. The Korean softer and lighter; the English denser and reedier. They each inspire totally different characters. After living in the US for the past year, she says her voice has completely changed. “Lately someone asked me, ‘How do you speak in Korean?’ And I started speaking and it was a whole different person with a whole different personality.” She’s thinking of learning another language, most likely more Japanese than she already speaks: “Maybe if I learned that even more I would have a whole different personality there as well.”\nBeyond the linguistic differences, I’m curious to know how Rosé squares typically American values of vulnerability with Korean values of inseong gyoyuk (humility and loyalty), but she gives cautiously diplomatic answers, politely dismissing the idea of cultural difference in favour of a universal narrative. “We’re all human, and I think the same things trigger and heal emotions,” she says.\nWith her American publicist and member of her Korean team listening in, she generally sounds a little clipped. She is understandably nervous to speak on the record. “Words are forever,” she explains. I ask whether she has any Grammy aspirations, given the success of the album. “I mean, that would be…” she looks around her, pauses, then regathers herself. “OK, I want to answer this,” she says, holding her knees. She goes again, the talkshow voice switched on: “That would be incredible. But I think if it means more to my community, it’d be special. That’s the first thing that I want, and whatever awards or celebration comes after it, that would feel extra-rewarding.” It’s a perfect pageant answer, but I suspect a sincere one all the same.\n\nIf you work until you sleep that’s great. That means you love it. Even when I’m not working, my brain is.\n\nI ask a few more seemingly innocuous questions, but she can’t answer them. Like, does she have a favourite One Direction member? “I do,” she says, “But I know this is going to make headlines so I want to be careful. It’ll cause too much drama.” I think to myself ‘Zayn?’, then leave it at that. I also ask whether she’ll continue spending time in Korea or head out to the States, and she can’t really answer that either. “I’m sorry, I don’t think I should be telling people my whereabouts,” she says, glumly. “See, these are the things I have to think about, it’s wild.”\nWe talk about food for a moment instead; Rosé’s comfort territory. While she used to eat almost exclusively Asian food, Korean mainly, lately she’s eaten anything she’s been given. She just had her first In-N-Out cheeseburger after watching Jennie’s set at Coachella. “I just swallowed that right up, it was amazing.”\nNow that she’s a celebrity who could have almost anything she wanted – a cheeseburger, say – I wonder whether she ever misses the feeling of craving. “See, it’s interesting because I might be able to get a burger when I need burgers. But I think it creates a lot of things I can’t have besides that.” Like what? “Like not having to be terrified of small things. Like not having to be the annoying person in the room full of my friends who is paranoid about something when I want to be very nonchalant and chill, but I have to be careful about everything. And even if I’m not doing anything wrong, I have to think, ‘What if this makes people think that I’m doing something wrong?’ And not always having the fear of being misunderstood. Like freedom.” And what does freedom look like to you? She looks around – “What does freedom look like to me?” – and answers, “Freedom means being anonymous.”\n\n\nLeather jacket and brass and resin earring SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY\nVACCARELLOPhotography CAMPBELL ADDY styling AERI YUN\n\nIn the past, Rosé went to such great lengths to recreate anonymity. She once went out on the streets disguised as an old woman, hoping to feel what it would be like to not be seen. Of course, she felt more paranoid than ever. The thought that people would see right through it, know instinctively that this was Rosé, never left her. The paranoia of a spy on a world mission. “It was really, really intense,” she says, “I don’t think I’ll ever do that again.”\nI ask if she’d ever consider acting as a way to slip out of herself for a moment and become someone else. “Wow, yes, I think that would be incredible in that sense,” she says. The question makes her think of the time she was hired to speak at a corporate event in Europe. She got up on stage, said, “Hello, I’m Rosie,” delivered a few lines, then faced one of her biggest fears: getting off the stage, walking from one side of the hall to another; walking through a crowd. “I was so anxious because usually when I walk through a big crowd of people I have to understand that people are going to recognise me and look at me.” But when she had to walk through the crowd of European businesspeople, no one seemed to notice. It was heaven. “I was jumping up and down after,” she says. “So, yes, I would love to act, because I’ll get to feel what it’s like to be anonymous.”\nShe scrunches her lips a little, looks to her side. For now, she’s still peering out from the wings, trying to guess how it feels to be anonymous; a fan among a crowd.\nHair LEE SEON-YEONG, make-up WON JUNGYO at BIT&BOOT, nails PARK EUNKYUNG, set design IBBY NJOYA at NEW SCHOOL REPRESENTS, prop stylist KIM SOJUNG, photographic assistants YANG HAYOUNG, KIM YOUJIN, KIM YOUNGWOO, hair assistant LEE SEUNGYEON, set design assistants SEO JIWOO, LEE EUNSU, florist LEE SOHYUN, lighting and digital operator SHIN YOUNGJAE, production KELLY SUH at A PRJECT, production coordinator INDIGO CHOI, production assistants KIM GITAE, LIM JAEWOO, post-production TOUCH DIGITAL, special thanks SAM ROSS and PHOEBE SHARDLOW at NEW SCHOOL REPRESENTS\n\n"

    "full_text": "With so many Australians doing big things in K-pop, a key question is why. How is it that Australia has produced so many homegrown K-pop stars?This is something Roald Maliangkay from the Australian National University has pondered.Roald Maliangkay is the Deputy Director of the Korea Institute at the Australian National University (ANU). (Supplied)And yes, he is named after the late decorated British children's author Roald Dahl.Professor Maliangkay specialises in popular culture in East Asia and has researched the South Korean entertainment industry throughout the 20th century up to the present day.He's come up with a few reasons why Australia is fertile ground for producing K-pop stars.Speaking the right language\"I think one important reason is that a lot of the Korean Australians here speak Korean, maybe not well, but they are fairly recent migrants,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"It's usually their parents who migrate to Australia and that means that their parents will speak Korean at home.\"I think that's one important reason so that makes it very likely for the trainees, which they are at first, to at least be familiar with the sounds so they can pick up Korean quite easily even if they didn't always speak Korean at home or outside in public.\"So, I think the language aspect is quite significant.\"Greater convergence of Asian AustraliansProfessor Maliangkay says demographics plays a part.\"I read a piece by Jayson Chun who wrote on the website of the International Institute for Asian Studies recently that the number of Australians who are Asian is about 17.4 per cent,\"  Professor Maliangkay said.\"Of course, we are a very small country in terms of population but if you look at cities like Sydney and Melbourne then the concentration of Asians around you will be much greater which probably provides a bit of an impetus for young people to try and establish their own identity and be noticed.\"And I think that is another driver for young Australians with an Asian background to perhaps try their luck at becoming a K-pop artist.\"The way Australians communicate\"Another factor is that communication amongst Australians tends to be rather positive,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"People here communicate in a very positive manner.\"Australians are really good at representing themselves and in engaging in conversation so that also makes things easy for an agency.\"Australians are generally very polite, they're pleasant and they use a lot of words like fantastic, wonderful and great, which when you go to Britain that is not exactly the case.\"Are politics at play?Professor Maliangkay says it's unlikely there are political reasons at play, but it could be a tiny factor.\"I don't think it is very likely that it's a political decision not to go with a United States-born artist,\" he said.\"But I do think that it's a little easier for Chinese fans to fall in love with a non-US based idol than it is when you're dealing with someone born in Australia.\"It's a tiny factor and the fans ultimately will fall in love anyway, but I think it might make things just a little easier.\"The time difference\"If you're a young person and you want to go to a workshop in Korea and try your luck at an audition, at the moment, the time difference between us and Seoul is one hour only,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"So, that makes going back-and-forth even when you're in high school just a little easier.\"Again, that's a tiny reason just like the political one but the other reasons I'm more sure of, that is, the language aspect, the greater convergence of Asian Australians and then the communication and the representation of Australians in general.\"So, who has made it big and who is on their way?Blackpink's RoséBlackpink's Rosé made history when her collaboration with Bruno Mars APT debuted at number one on the ARIA singles chart making her the first solo female K-pop star to top the ARIA chart.\"She was born in New Zealand but then she was raised in Melbourne, I think from the age of seven and then she trained herself singing in church choirs,\" says Professor Maliangkay.\"She just suddenly had the courage when she was quite young, I think she was 16, to pack her bags and go to YG entertainment where she went to train, and it worked out.\"In the beginning, she was an absolute nobody, of course, and risked a lot doing all this and spending money on this.\"In interviews, she's very modest about it because this was really quite a risk she took and then, of course, now she's just this global superstar.\"Hanni and Danielle from NewJeansNewJeans broke a Guinness World Record when they became the fastest K-pop act to reach a billion streams on Spotify, unseating BTS.They have two Australian members.\"Danielle was born outside a big city, in Newcastle, NSW,\" Professor Maliangkay said.Danielle from NewJeans was born in Newcastle, NSW. (Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR)\"She has an Australian father and a Korean mother.\"And they moved to Korea in 2019 at around the age of 14.\"She was kind of scouted by HYBE.\"Hanni was born in Melbourne to Vietnamese parents.Hanni from NewJeans was born in Melbourne. (Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR)\"[She] moved to Seoul around 2020 at the age of 16 so that would make her 21 right now.\"She also ended up with the same company, with HYBE.\"What's going on with HYBE?Fans of K-pop would be aware of some recent news surrounding the multinational entertainment company HYBE.\"HYBE has come under serious scrutiny,\"  Professor Maliangkay said.\"Although the company has responded to the recent allegations of insider trading by a former executive saying it is fully cooperating with the authorities, it denies any wrongdoing by chairman Bang Si-hyuk.\"And yet, since December, Bang has been under police investigation on suspicion of profiting by as much as $450 million from misleading shareholders during the company's listing.\"HYBE has issued the following statement to ABC News on the matter.\"We cooperated with the authorities in response to their request for information concerning the conduct of a former employee.\"Regarding NewJeans, Professor Maliangkay says fans were distraught to learn of a stand-off between NewJeans and parent company HYBE.\"What is more, following the public fallout over management rights with former CEO Min Hee-jin of ADOR that began in April last year, NewJeans's activities have now been put on hold, with ADOR last Friday winning an injunction against the group members engaging in any unauthorised individual entertainment activities until the legal process has run its course,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"The idols stand by Min and argue that HYBE's reorganisation of ADOR has turned it into something very different from the label they signed with.\"Conflicts between idols and their management over contracts are not uncommon. Groups like Fifty Fifty, Loona, and TVXQ have faced serious disputes, some of which have led to their disbandment.\"While the high stakes of investment and intense competition help explain the often inequitable nature of contracts, fans typically rally behind the idols, so the companies almost always stand to lose from public disputes.\"I suspect that quite a few fans will respond to the scandals either by not investing as much money in HYBE products, or embracing the idols of other agencies, or both.\"Despite the negative reports surrounding HYBE's management, however, fans' excitement for BTS's long-awaited return — marked by SUGA's military discharge on June 21 — will likely remain undiminished.\"HYBE subsidiary ADOR has issued the following statement.\"We express our sincere gratitude for the court's judicious decision to grant the preliminary injunction.\"With our status as NewJeans' exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward.\"Felix and Bang Chan of Stray KidsStray Kids has two Australian members — Felix (fifth from left) and Bang Chan (third from right, back row). (Supplied: Virgin Music Group)Felix was born and raised in Sydney and Bang Chan was born in Seoul and grew up in Sydney.\"Felix is the fashion icon, partly, of Stray Kids and he's doing really well in that sense in addition to of course being a very talented performer,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"Bang Chan is also very much a composer.\"He has his own kind of composing agency as well.\"So, he's composed quite a lot of music for Stray Kids.\"He's also the leader of [the group].\"If I had to pick the top K-pop groups at the moment, NewJeans and Stray Kids would be in that list.\"It's quite something to have both groups having two Australian members so it is significant and that's why I think it's very good to ask indeed why is it?\"Because you do wonder why is it that there are so many Australians [in K-pop].\"Lily from NMIXXNMIXX will be perform in Australia this month with Lily (third from left) returning home for the shows. (Supplied: Virgin Music Group)NMIXX's Lily is returning home this month to perform in Melbourne and Sydney.\"Lily was born in Marysville, Victoria to a Korean mother and an Australian father,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"About 10 years ago, she left to work for JYP Entertainment.\"She signed a contract in 2015 and eventually then into 2022 she then debuted with NMIXX, which means seven years of training and preparation before you actually end up being a frontline act.\"It's a long time to just be training, it's a bit like doing a PhD.\"Jake from Enhypen\"Jake was born in South Korea but then grew up in Brisbane,\" Professor Maliangkay said.\"He moved back to Seoul in 2019 and then trained under HYBE.Jake from Enhypen grew up in Brisbane. (Supplied: Courtesy of BELIFT LAB)\"Roughly after one year he was made part of Enhypen and I think they're doing quite well.\"Of course, Brisbane also has a very large Asian community, so I suppose there's a little bit of an impetus for young Asian Australians to kind of stand out a little bit and do something different, be noticed, and then of course with all trainees the lure of fame, money, fashion, and perhaps cosmetic surgery, which is definitely one of the perks, because the agencies will help you arrange that.\"Mackiah from ampers&one and n.SSign's RobinOthers to watch out for are Robin from n.SSign, who has debuted, and who said on TikTok that he went to the same school as Felix from Stray Kids and cites the whole group as role models.AndMackiah from ampers&one who is from Western Sydney and debuted in 2023."

    "full_text": "\n\tBillie Eilish led the winners for the 2025 American Music Awards, the largest fan-voted awards show, which returned with host and performer Jennifer Lopez in Sin City’s Fontainebleau luxury resort following a two-year hiatus. The nine-time Grammy and two-time Oscar winner was triumphant in all seven of her nominated categories.\n\n\n\n\n\tDespite leading nominations with a total of 10 nods and having a banner year, Kendrick Lamar won only a single category, Favorite Hip-Hop Song, with smash hit “Not Like Us.”\n\n\n\n\n\tNew categories this year included Album of the Year and Song of the Year, both won by Eilish, as well as Social Song of the Year, which Doechii’s “Anxiety” claimed.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tArtists Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Eminem, Post Malone, SZA, The Weeknd and Twenty One Pilots all took home multiple trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\tPerformers during the ceremony included Blake Shelton, Gloria Estefan, Gwen Stefani, Reneé Rapp, Benson Boone, and Lainey Wilson, and Janet Jackson was the recipient of the Icon Award for her legacy in music. Rod Stewart, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award, closed out the evening with an energetic performance. (See who walked the red carpet in their finery here.)\n\n\n\n\n\tThe CBS and Dick Clark Productions fete aired live coast-to-coast at 8 p.m. ET on CBS, Paramount+ and Harmony, Deadline’s parent company Penske Media’s proprietary live streaming platform.\n\n\n\n\n\tSee the full list of winners below:\n\n\n\n\n\tARTIST OF THE YEARAriana GrandeBillie EilishChappell RoanKendrick LamarMorgan

：尼克和安妮携手度过了二十五年，在即将迎来婚姻周年庆的这天，他们邀请了挚友杰克与安妮夫妇、丹尼与克劳德夫妇一起度假。为了感谢这么多年的陪伴，安妮邀请了所有的好友，决定复刻当年二人的婚礼，可谁知道，尼克已经决定和她离婚了。Netflix 于本月推出的美剧《四季情》，改编自 1981 年的同名电影，并且一经播出就收获了较好的口碑，成功续订第二季。剧集一共八集，每两集为一个季节，以春、夏、秋、冬的四次好友共同旅行作为切入点，通过对主角一行人的故事，反映出了当下现实生活里婚姻的不同面向。虽然每集的时长不长，但剧集依然完美利用好了这半小时的篇幅，讲了一个较为饱满的故事。在延续了原版电影精华的基础上，增加了 LGBTQ、开放式婚姻等话题，让剧情更为丰富。高效叙事方式所呈现出的婚姻、恋爱、家庭和友情等元素，不仅没有一点冗余的情节，也极其现实。[美剧] 杀戮人机关键词：小说改 / 科幻 / 喜剧 / 动作片长：约 25 分钟（单集）× 10 集，每周五更新观看渠道：Apple TV+；豆瓣链接不想追肥皂剧的机器人不是好保镖。@SHY：被愚蠢的人类奴役虐待多年后，一位胸怀大志的安保机器人终于黑掉了调控中枢，并给自己起名为 Murderbot。获得自由意志的他，誓要消灭人类暴政，解放硅基同胞……这破差事谁爱干谁干，还是用公司网络追剧舒服。本想保持低调的他，却被一群科学家带到了未知星球，只得在危险关头挺身而出。看腻了人工智能灭世的论调，这部不按常理出牌的科幻喜剧显得格外清新。说到底，是否会主动偷懒是辨别高等智慧的唯一标准，哪天 AI 真觉醒了意识，一直摸鱼一直爽才是理性之选。表面社恐而内心戏十足的杀戮人机，遇到难题只想逃避，时刻不忘吐槽大业，过于真实的心理活动，总能让观众会心一笑。改编自同名畅销小说，这部制作精良的 Apple TV+ 剧集，从新角度探讨 AI 人权等老生常谈的议题，一开始兴致寥寥的杀戮人机，在与平等相处的同伴的交流中，逐渐诞生了更多人性。以机器人为视角叙事，也为稍显俗套的异星冒险赋予了更多吸引力，编排层层递进的悬念，渲染山雨欲来的氛围，让人想继续追下去。[电影] 丑陋的继姐关键词：剧情 / 恐怖片长：110 分钟；豆瓣链接我们离开吧。@利兹与青鸟：我们都知道灰姑娘的父亲死后，被恶毒的继母和继姐磋磨，当成仆人使唤，最终在仙子的帮助下和王子过上了幸福的生活。可在继姐埃尔薇拉的视角下故事又是什么样子，挪威导演为我们揭开了童话的另一面。对爱情有着美好憧憬的埃尔薇拉，虽不像继妹艾格妮丝一样美丽动人，但也是一个天真可爱的丰腴少女，母亲带着她和妹妹嫁给贵族继父也是为了能有更好的生活，不料继父骤然离世，家中一贫如洗，于是嫁给王子的目标让母亲和埃尔薇拉陷入癫狂。这部带着邪典味的黑暗童话，有着古典而优雅的摄影和布景，也有着残酷可怖又血腥猎奇的特写，在迷幻的电子乐中，氛围诡异而迷人。电影将奇幻童话与肮脏现实相交织，极具讽刺意味，颠覆美好也创造反叛的希望。当观众看到埃尔薇拉用尽全力、受尽折磨和羞辱，却不能如愿，而灰姑娘如有神助时，很难不感叹命运的不公，但更为物化自我的旧社会规则而感到悲哀。喜欢《故事的故事》风格的朋友想必也会喜欢本片，但不要在吃饭时间观看。[英剧] 格雷斯 第五季关键词：剧情 / 悬疑 / 犯罪片长：90 分钟左右（单集）× 4 集；豆瓣链接We're keeping all lines of enquiry open. （我们还是要考虑到各种的可能性。）@潘誉晗 ：一桩入室袭击案，引出了一段由古董手表牵扯出来的陈年过往；身份不明的男人被抛尸在山上，经法医鉴定，他的死因竟是溺死于羊奶里；修路的工人在施工时，挖出了一具尸体，这是埋藏在水泥下尘封了三十年的案件，同时，又有一男一女失踪了；心狠手辣的黑寡妇与军队出身的杀手，开启了互为目标的追捕。根据犯罪惊悚小说家彼得·詹姆斯小说改编的《格雷斯》第五季，依然以探长罗伊·格雷斯为主角，以一集一案的模式，为我们带来了四个精致又小巧的故事。依靠在海边的小城景致很美，遗憾的是在这般怡人的海滨城市里，依然有小镇谋杀案在上演。好在，还有格雷斯探长和他的靠谱同事在。没有什么多余的花里胡哨噱头，就是大家一起根据已知线索抽丝剥茧，找出最终真相，冷峻且理性，克制并专业。于是每一位警探都发挥了自己的本事，在人物形象塑造这点上，剧集平衡得很不错。[国产] 人生若如初见关键词：剧情 / 历史片长：45 分钟左右（单集）× 40 集观看渠道：爱奇艺视频；豆瓣链接历史的青春挽歌。@潘誉晗 ：1901 年，光绪二十七年。经历了庚子国变后的晚清政府为了挽救岌岌可危的统治，派遣了一批青年远赴日本学习军事。旗人出身的梁乡、革命派青年杨凯之、袁世凯亲信李人骏三人，因此结缘。可惜的是昔日同窗回国后，因为各自不同的立场和阵营走向了截然不同的道路。另一边，因为跟着满怀革命热忱的青年吴天白流亡日本的谢菽红，也走出了富商之女的身份，在异国奋斗为一名坚强的独立女性。因为涉及的题材敏感，所以三年前曾昙花一现过一晚的剧集这次重新上架，带着明显的删改痕迹。好在作为一部群像戏，几位青年演员表现得不错，虽然有部分人物的设定引起了一番争议，但恰好是这样毫不掩饰且不美化的方式，也许残忍，却也更具真实性，毕竟当年的历史本就复杂。除了演员们的表现之外，剧集的整体质感也很不错。考究的服化道和美术场景，也尽可能地还原出了那个时代的特色。[动画] 阳光马达棒球场！关键词：漫画改 / 日常 / 喜剧 / 运动片长：24 分钟（单集）× 12 集，每周二更新观看渠道：Crunchyroll；豆瓣链接Come On You Suns!@SHY：场上拼搏的球员们固然耀眼，场下应援的球迷们热情也毫不逊色，即使是多年无冠的千叶阳光马达棒球俱乐部，比赛日的主场也永远人声鼎沸。总是独自坐在散客席的上班族村田，偶然成为了新来的啤酒小妹琉璃子的常客，以此为起点，充满欢声笑语的球场日常拉开帷幕。讲述棒球运动的日本漫画要多少有多少，本作则另辟蹊径，关注聚集在棒球场的人们。球员和观众自不必说，保安、导播、销售员、吉祥物等工作人员同样值得被看见。以能接触到各色人等的琉璃子为线索，球场内外的众生相一一展现，不知不觉间，就立住了数十位角色，不以比赛为中心，也能直观传达棒球的魅力。有趣的单元剧之外，本作也不失运动作品的底色，用暗线铺陈小球会的逆袭。无论是状态逐渐下滑的老将，还是将这里当成跳板的外援，都可能遇上改变生涯的契机，只要全员齐心协力，就能冲击更大的舞台。胜利时尽情狂欢，失败时加油鼓劲，这段所有人共同写就的故事，让人不止开怀一笑，更能收获热血和感动。[纪录片] 全美缉凶：本·拉登关键词：纪录片 / 历史 / 犯罪片长：60 分钟左右（单集）× 3 集观看渠道：Netflix；豆瓣链接「9·11 事件」后，全球猎杀本·拉登。@潘誉晗 ：2001 年，时任美国总统的布什在弗罗里达州的一所小学参加活动。就在他给学生们讲故事时，布什方接到来电，说有架飞机撞上了世贸中心。起初，他们还以为是一次小型飞机事故，和中情局（后简称「CIA」） 通话之后才意识到这起事件的严重性。那天是 9 月 11 日，也就是震惊世界的「9·11 事件」。Netflix 这次所推出的纪录片，以事件发生时的真实录像开篇，然后聚焦美国对本·拉登的追缉行动。提起「9·11 事件」，相信很多人并不陌生，如何把这个妇孺皆知的故事讲好，尤为考验团队能力。纪录片通过真实的影像记录、CIA 人员的访谈记录、档案分析和揭秘等，对事件进行了再现和还原。紧张、刺激、悬疑感拉满，加上一些从未揭露过的细节展示，配合着出众的音乐，这部浓缩成三集的纪录片，就像是一部节奏得当的刑侦片般精彩。这段不愿回望的历史是一场巨大的悲剧，十年追缉路，原来也充满了各种戏剧性。更多[电影] 终极对弈 @利兹与青鸟：这部改编自真实事件的传记电影，记录了韩国围棋宗师曹薰铉与天才少年李昌镐从师徒到对手的传奇故事，情节跌宕，有真挚而矛盾的师徒情、精彩紧张的顶尖交锋，更有关突破自我与接受输赢。昏黄的色调颇有年代感，人物个性鲜明，演员虽全员熟脸，但演技都称得上「剧抛脸」，希望当代韩国棋手也能有片中人物的风骨。[电影] 等待达利 @利兹与青鸟：1974 年的西班牙社会动荡，费尔南多跟着弟弟逃亡到达利的故乡，在一家名为「超现实」的餐厅工作。餐厅以达利名画中的元素为装饰，等待他的光临。这里有阳光、海风、解放天性、追求自由的地中海风情，费尔南多创作出一道道宛如艺术品般的佳肴，竟意外成为了「餐饮界的新达利」。电影色彩明丽，带着些许奇幻味道和梦想家的执着，让人心情愉悦，也有几分感动。[美剧] 思想很危险 @潘誉晗：「观众永远猜不到下面的走向是什么」系列，每集大概 20 分钟的剧集由一个个段子组成，每集大概 2-3 个短片：嘴上说着不杀妇女和孩童的杀手违背了自己的杀人准则、为了创作出更好的音乐绑架自己歌迷的歌手、恋老癖在老人院获得了超高人气……很无厘头，很恶趣味，也很限制级，建议绝对不要在吃饭的时候观看哦～[动画] 测不准的阿波连同学 第二季 @SHY：不会拿捏距离的阿波连和来堂，关系时远时近的两人，经历这样那样的故事后，终于开始交往。然而，与新学期一同到来的，是同样测不准的转学生玉那霸陆，非同一般的青春物语再次启航。延续第一季的路数，本季用一众个性鲜明的登场角色，继续谱写脑洞大开的日常喜剧，整体质量依旧稳健，适合放空大脑观看，喜欢前作的话，放心追准没错。[动画] 每日男公关 @SHY：位置并非新宿的歌舞伎町一条街，有着一家美男子汇聚的夜总会，无论是温柔奶狗，还是霸道总裁，但凡顾客心怡的款型，这里应有尽有，在前辈们的指导下，新入行的阿一每日进步中。虽然只是每集 3 分钟的泡面番，本作的搞笑程度不甘示弱，编排贴合主题的各式段子，揭晓不为人知的牛郎日常，隐含对这一行当的反思，适合不想努力的观众学习。[动画] 星球大战：黑市传说 @潘誉晗：这一次的星战动画以阿莎洁·凡崔斯为主角，讲述了凡崔斯被复活之后，与相遇的莱科结伴，一同寻找「路径」组织的故事。而这场属于宇宙的公路之旅，又因为完美融合了科幻感和工业感，氛围十足，动作戏的处理也不错。动画整体采用的是短剧形式，每一集的时长在 15 分钟左右，一口气看完六集，完全没有压力。[纪录片] 疾速剧痛 @Sholmes：该片讲述了《疾速追杀》的幕后故事，片中有从未公开的拍摄花絮和剧组的独家采访。编剧德里克写了一个如果狗被杀会怎样的故事，拉开了电影制作的序幕。《四十七浪人》口碑很差，没有导演想接拍基努·里维斯的功夫片，电影也遇到了巨大的资金缺口。制作团队不得不克服重重困难，最终这部独立电影及其续作收获了超过 10 亿美元的票房。📅 本周新预告《疯狂动物城 2》发布首支预告5 月 21
